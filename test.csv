If a current is now passed in the rod as shown in figure 2 . 22a , you will observe that the rod gets displaced . This displacement is caused by the force acting on the current carrying rod . In accordance with Fleming ' s left hand rule , the magnet exerts a force on the rod directed upwards , with the result that the rod will get deflected upwards . Now , reverse the direction of current ( or interchange the poles of the magnet ) as shown in figure 2 . 22b , you will observe that the rod is now displaced downwards i . e . , deflection of the rod has reversed .

Suppose a resistor R is connected to a cell ( Figure 4 . 23 ) . The Fig . 4 . 23 cell maintains a potential difference V across the resistor , driving a current i through it . So , V = iR .

Before we go further and discuss electric current , please answer the following questions :"

In this discussion we have considered the magnetic field produced by a circular loop ( or circular wire ) which consists of only ' one turn ' of the wire . The strength of magnetic field can be increased by taking a circular coil consisting of a number of turns of insulated copper wire closely wound together . Thus , if there is a circular coil having n turns , the magnetic field produced by this current - carrying circular coil will be n times as large as that produced by a circular loop of a single turn of wire . This is because the current in each circular turn of coil flows in the same direction and magnetic field produced by each turn of circular coil then just adds up . We can now say that : The strength of magnetic field produced by a circular coil carrying current is directly proportional to both , number of turns ( n ) and current ( I ) ; but inversely proportional to its radius ( r ) . Thus , the strength of magnetic field produced by a current - carrying circular coil can be increased : ( i ) by increasing the number of turns of wire in the coil , ( ii ) by increasing the current flowing through the coil , and ( iii ) by decreasing the radius of the coil ."

Presbyopia is that defect of vision due to which an old person cannot see the nearby objects clearly due to loss of power of accommodation of the eye . For example , an old person having presbyopia cannot read a book or newspaper comfortably and clearly without spectacles . Presbyopia occurs in old age due to the gradual weakening of the ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of the eye - lens . The near - point of the old person having presbyopia gradually recedes and becomes much more than 25 centimetres away . Actually , presbyopia is a special kind of hypermetropia .

The sides AB and CD of the coil are kept perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field between the poles of the magnet . This is done so that the maximum magnetic force is exerted on the current - carrying sides AB and CD of the coil . A device which reverses the direction of current through a circuit is called a commutator ( or split ring ) . The two ends of the coil are soldered ( or welded ) permanently to the two half rings X and Y of a commutator . A commutator is a copper ring split into two parts X and Y , these two parts are insulated from one another and mounted on the shaft of the motor . End A of the coil is welded to part X of the commutator and end D of the coil is welded to part Y of the commutator . The commutator rings are mounted on the shaft of the coil and they also rotate when the coil rotates . As we will see later on , the function of commutator rings is to reverse the direction of current flowing through the coil every time the coil just passes the vertical position during a revolution . In other words , commutator rings reverse the direction of current flowing through the coil after every half rotation of the coil ."

You know that plants trap solar energy in the form of food , and animals get energy when they eat the plants . Since fossil fuels came from plants and animals , their ultimate source of energy is the sun . We get a number of different fuels from coal and petroleum . For example , we get petrol , diesel , kerosene and LPG from petroleum , and coke and natural gas from coal . When burnt in air , fossil fuels give off heat , which is used for various purposes — from cooking to generating electricity . However , these fuels are nonrenewable , and their reserves are running out . Unfortunately , we cannot repeat the events that led to their formation . Fossil fuels have played an important role in the technological advances made in the last three hundred years or so . Even today , most of the energy requirements of homes , industries and transport are met by fossil fuels . It is estimated that about 25 % of our total energy consumption comes from coal . More than 90 % of this coal is used for electricity generation in thermal power plants . In most thermal power plants , coal is burnt to heat water for producing steam . The steam falls on the blades of a special kind of wheel called a turbine . A turbine is a device that rotates when steam , water or wind falls on its blades . The turbine turns the shaft of an electric generator to which it is connected . In this way electricity is produced ."

Hence , the refractive index of the material of a prism is different for different colours of light . So , when white light enters a prism , its different components ( lights of different colours ) bend by different amounts . This causes the components to separate out , or split . While emerging from the prism , they undergo a second refraction and bend further , increasing the separation between the colours . In this way , white light gets split into its component colours on passing through a prism . Note that the component colours of white light bend by different amounts for all refractions . So , why does not light get split while passing through a rectangular slab ? Light bends by equal angles but in opposite directions at the parallel faces of a rectangular slab .

This loss in mass gets converted into energy . Energy released in fission reactions You must have heard of Einstein ' s famous equation , E = mc² . In this equation , E , m and c stand for energy , mass and the speed of light in vacuum respectively . From this equation we can get the amount of energy released when matter of a certain mass is destroyed . Taking c = 3 x 108 m / s in vacuum , 1 kg of disappearing mass will give rise to 9 x 1016 J of energy . When dealing with atoms and nuclei , scientists prefer to measure mass in a unit called atomic mass unit ( u ) , which is defined as 112 of the mass of one atom of carbon - 12 . And they often use the unit electronvolt ( eV ) to measure energy . 1 u ~ 1 . 67 x 10 - 27 kg . 1 eV - 1 . 6x 10 - 19 J .

From the fission of one U - 236 nucleus , we get about 200 x 10 eV ( 200 MeV ) of energy .

When we look at stars , quite often they do not appear to shine steadily . They disappear for a fraction of a second before reappearing ( the intensity of light from them fluctuates ) , or their positions seem to shift slightly in random directions . We call this the twinkling of stars . Let us see why this happens . Since the temperature of air and its humidity are not the same everywhere in the atmosphere , the refractive index of air varies between different masses ( or pockets ) of air , even at the same altitude . Thus , there exist air pockets whose refractive index is different from that of the air surrounding it . When a ray of light passes through such a pocket of air , it bends due to refraction ( Figure 2 . 32 ) . Light from a star may pass through one or more air pockets before reaching the eye . But the air pockets keep moving . So , the direction of the ray reaching the eye keeps changing , causing the image of | Air pockets of different - the star to shift in random directions or even densities disappear for an instant . The amount of starlight reaching the eye also keeps changing due to the shift in the direction of the light . So , the brightness of the star seems Fig . 2 . 32 to change . The stars near the horizon twinkle more than those that are overhead . This is because light from a star near the horizon has to cover much more distance in the atmosphere than that from stars which are overhead . Therefore , it has greater chances of encountering air pockets whose density is different from the surrounding air . Why planets do not twinkle Planets do not seem to twinkle like stars , although light coming from them also passes through the air pockets in the atmosphere . This is because stars appear as point objects to us due to their enormous distance from the earth . On the other hand , planets are comparatively nearer , and therefore , for us they are more like extended objects . Light from different parts of the planet form an extended image at the eye , and we are unable to detect the random shifts in the smaller portions of this image . PO SO 2820"

A resistance of 6 ohms is connected in series with another resistance of 4 ohms . A potential difference of 20 volts is applied across the combination . Calculate the current through the circuit and potential difference across the 6 ohm resistance . Solution . The first step in solving such problems based on current 612 electricity is to draw a proper circuit diagram . For example , in this problem we have two resistances of 6 ohms and 4 ohms which are connected in series . So , first of all we have to draw these two resistances on paper as shown in Figure alongside . Now , a potential difference of 20 volts has been applied across this combination of resistances . So , we draw a cell or a battery of 20 volts and complete the circuit as shown in Figure alongside . Suppose the current flowing in the circuit is I amperes . We will now find out the value of current I flowing through the circuit . To do this we should know the total resistance R of the circuit . Here we have two resistances of 6 22 and 412 connected in series . So , Total resistance , R = R2 + R2 R = 6 + 4 R = 10 ohms Now , Total resistance , R = 10 ohms Potential difference , V = 20 volts and , Current in the circuit , I = ? ( To be calculated ) So , applying Ohm ' s law to the whole circuit , we get : 20 v So that , And , 20 = 10 10 I = 20 1 = 10 So , Current , I = 2 amperes ( or 2 A ) Thus , the current flowing through the circuit is 2 amperes . The second part of this problem is to find out the potential difference across the ends of the 6 ohm resistance . To do this we will have to apply Ohm ' s law to this resistance only . We know that the current flowing through the 6 ohm resistance will also be 2 amperes . Now , Potential difference ( across 6 12 resistance ) , V = ? ( To be calculated ) Current ( through 6 12 resistance ) , I = 2 amperes And , Resistance , R = 6 ohms So , applying Ohm ' s law to the 6 12 resistance only , we get : T = R or"

A domestic - gas cylinder contains about 13 kg of LPG . Smaller cylinders are also available . A strong - smelling substance called ethyl mercaptan ( C2H5SH ) is added to the LPG to detect the leakage of gas from the cylinder . When the regulator valve of the gas cylinder and the knob of the stove are opened , the pressure over the liquid in the cylinder decreases . As a result , some of it vaporises and reaches the burner through a tube connecting the cylinder to the stove . On being lighted , the gas burns with a blue flame . One gram of LPG produces about 30 kJ of heat . It is a clean burning fuel that does not produce pollutants like carbon monoxide and ash ."

A glass prism is a five - sided solid with a triangular cross section . Thus , it has two parallel , triangular faces and three rectangular faces that are inclined to each other . In experiments , a prism is usually placed on one of its triangular faces such that its rectangular faces are vertical . Light falling on a rectangular face ( adfc in Figure 3 . 1 ) enters the prism and emerges from another rectangular face ( befc ) . Figure 3 . 2 shows the cross section of a prism on which a ray of light PQ is incident . The ray PQ makes an angle i ¡ with the normal to the surface at Q . Since the ray enters glass ( optically denser medium ) from air , it bends towards the normal . Hence , the ray bends towards the base AB . Within the prism , the ray travels along QR , and falls on the surface CB at R . At this surface , the ray passes from glass to air , and hence , it bends away from the normal .

When a beam of light consisting of light waves and travelling in a certain medium falls obliquely ( at an angle ) on the boundary of another medium , then one part of the light waves enters into the other medium first and its speed changes first but the rest of waves enter the other medium a little later and hence its speed changes a little later . The fact that the speed of light waves on one side of a beam of light changes a little before the change in speed of light waves on its other side , causes a change in the direction of light . And this change in direction of light is called refraction of light or bending of light . This will become more clear from the following example in which a beam of light is entering from air into a glass slab obliquely and then emerging into air from its other side ."

Acid rain damages soil , water bodies , crops , living tissues and structures like the Taj Mahal . ( d ) The unburnt particles produced during the combustion of fossil fuels are carried by smoke . They affect our lungs , and blacken clothes and buildings . The pollution caused by burning coal can be greatly reduced by installing a tall chimney or by installing a precipitator , which is a device that reduces the amount of suspended matter in the smoke ."

Ans . : In domestic circuits , series arrangement is not used because of the following reasons : ( i ) The total potential difference available ( usually 220 volts ) is divided between various appliances in the circuit according to their resistances since the current flowing through all the appliances is the same . Thus , each appliance will not get the required potential difference for it to operate properly . ( ii ) If one of the appliances is out of order , e . g . , if a bulb gets fused , all the appliances in the circuit will stop working as the circuit gets broken . ( iii ) All the appliances will work simultaneously whether we want them to work or not , thereby involving a lot of power wastage . ( iv ) If we switch off any one of the appliances , the circuit is broken and all the appliances will stop working ."

This is because for the incident ray the angle of incidence i = 0 . Therefore , angle of refraction r is also zero . Therefore , no refraction occurs at the edge , and there is no bending . Similarly , no refraction occurs at the other edge when the ray of light comes out of the glass slab . When we look at the portion of the line from the top of the glass slab , it appears to be raised . This is also due to the phenomenon of refraction of light .

The simplest way to maintain a potential difference between the two ends of a conductor so as to get a continuous flow of current is to connect the conductor between the terminals of a cell or a battery . Due to the chemical reactions going on inside the cell or battery , a potential difference is maintained between its terminals . And this potential difference drives the current in a circuit in which the cell or battery is connected . For example , a single dry cell has a potential difference of 1 . 5 volts between its two terminals ( + terminal and – terminal ) . So , when a dry cell is connected to a torch bulb through copper connecting wires , then its potential difference causes the electric current to flow through the copper wires and the bulb , due to which the bulb lights up ( see Figure 8 ) . In order to maintain current in the external circuit , the cell has to expend the chemical energy which is stored in it .

For a concave lens , F1 is on the right and F2 is on the left of the lens . For a thin lens , the distances of Fį and F , from the optical centre are the same . This distance is called the focal length of the lens . Also , we usually use the word ' focus ' for each of the two principal focii . It is generally clear from the situation whether we are talking of For F , and a common symbol F is used for them . Thus we can define the focus and focal length of a thin lens as follows . In a thin lens , rays incident parallel to the principal axis after passing through the lens converge to or appear to diverge from a point on the principal axis . And , the rays coming from a point on the principal axis or rays going towards a point on it become parallel to the principal axis after passing through the lens . Each of these two points is called a focus of the thin lens , and the distance of the focus from the optical centre is called its focal length . Usually , when we say ' focus ' , we mean the second principal focus . Since a parallel beam of light incident on a convex lens converges on the other side , a convex lens is also called a converging lens ( Figure 2 . 15a ) . On the other hand , a parallel beam of light incident on a concave lens diverges on the other side ( Figure 2 . 15b ) . A concave lens is therefore also called a diverging lens ."

Please note that the ammeter has been put in series with the circuit but the voltmeter has been put in parallel with the 12 12 resistor . We will now calculate the current reading in the ammeter and potential difference reading in the voltmeter . ( i ) Calculation of current flowing in the circuit .

It may damage your eyes . Hold a concave mirror in your hand and direct its reflecting surface towards the Sun . • Direct the light reflected by the mirror on to a sheet of paper held close to the mirror . Move the sheet of paper back and forth gradually until you find on the paper sheet a bright , sharp spot of light . • Hold the mirror and the paper in the same position for a few minutes . What do you observe ? Why ? DISCUSSION : The sun , which is the source of light , in this case is at infinite distance from the concave mirror . Therefore , on reflection from the concave mirror , its image is formed at the focus of the mirror . By moving the sheet of paper back and forth gradually , we obtain a point size image of the sun . When we hold the mirror and the paper in the same position for a few minutes the paper burns out . This is because the sun rays at this point are highly concentrated thereby producing a lot of heat , which burns the paper . The distance of the point image of the sun from the mirror gives the rough focal length of the mirror . 4 . 36 Textbook of Physics - 10"

Therefore , the angle of refraction is greater than the angle of incidence , i . e . , r > i . Now , if the angle of incidence i increases , the angle of refraction r increases . For a particular value of i , called the critical angle ( ic ) , the angle of refraction becomes 90° ( Figure 2 . 9b ) . The refracted ray then comes out parallel to the surface separating the two media . What happens for an angle of incidence greater than the critical angle ? You would expect the angle of refraction to be more than 90° . This would bring the ray back into the first medium . But that would not be refraction . This means that for an angle of incidence greater than ic , refraction is not possible . So , the ray reflects back into the first medium . This reflection obeys the laws of reflection , and therefore , r ' = in ( Figure 2 . 9c ) . Such a reflection is called total internal reflection .
