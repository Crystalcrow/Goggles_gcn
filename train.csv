It possesses enormous energy . As the energy is due to motion of air during its flow , the energy is kinetic . Source of wind energy : Solar energy heats the entire earth but the heating is not uniform . The heating is more intense near the equator than in the polar region . This makes air in the equator region more hot and light . It rises up and its space is filled with the cooler air from polar region . In this way air flows from colder region at high pressure to hotter region at low pressure . The flow of air from one place to other constitutes wind . The smooth flow of air is disturbed continuously by rotation of the earth as well as by the local conditions . Due to these interacting factor the wind speed may vary from 5 km / h to about 10 km / h ( gentle breeze ) to very high speed of about 800 km / h of a storm ( tornado ) ."

AB is an object placed perpendicular to the principal axis of a convex lens . To locate the image of the point B , we draw two rays , BD and BO . The ray BD is parallel to the principal axis and passes through the focus F after transmission through the lens . The ray BO passes through the optical centre 0 and is transmitted without deviation . The transmitted rays DF and OB ' intersect at B ' , which is the image of B . If we draw a perpendicular B ' A ' to the principal axis , A ' will be the image of A . Thus , A ' B ' is the image of AB . In the case shown in Figure 2 . 17 , the image A ' B ' is real . Fig . 2 . 17 Table 2 . 2 shows the ray diagrams for several cases of image formation by a convex lens . The object AB is placed perpendicular to the principal axis . The distance OF2 = OF is the focal length f . In the figures of this table , 2F , denotes a point on the same side as F2 , at a distance 2f from O . Similarly , 2F , denotes a point on the side of F , , at a distance 2f from O . Central line A Description In ( a ) , the object is at infinity . So , the incident rays are parallel . The transmitted rays meet at the focus F2 , where a point - sized , real image is formed . As the object is brought closer , the image moves away from the lens , and its size starts increasing from the point - sized image formed at the focus . The image is real and inverted . But as long as the object is beyond 2F1 , the size of the image is less than that of the object . This is shown in ( b ) . When the object is at 2F , i . e . , at a distance 2f from the lens , the image is formed at the same distance on the other side , at 2F % . This image is of the same size as the object . This is shown in ( c ) . When the object is between 2F , and Fj , the image forms beyond 2F2 , and its size is larger than that of the object . This is shown in ( d ) . What happens when the object is at the focus F / ? The ray diagram is shown in ( e ) . The rays coming from B become parallel after transmission . We can say that the transmitted rays intersect at infinity , and hence , form a real image . Also , this image is below the principal axis . Thus , the image of AB is said to be inverted , real and infinitely large . However , to the eye in the path of the transmitted rays , the rays appear to be coming from a point at infinity on the side of incident rays . Therefore , from the observer ' s point of view , the image is virtual , erect and infinitely large .

An electric current in a conductor also produces a magnetic field . This was first observed in 1820 by the Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted ( 1777 – 1851 ) . The magnetic effect of electric current can be very easily be demonstrated by bringing a magnetic compass near a current - carrying wire . The compass needle gets deflected , showing that a magnetic field is produced near the wire . Place a magnetic compass on a wooden or plastic block , away from all magnetic material . When the compass needle comes to rest , fix a wire over the compass , parallel to the needle . Connect the wire to a battery through a switch , as shown in Figure 5 . 3a . Close the switch to pass a current through the wire . The compass needle will get deflected , and come to rest at right angles to its original position . If the direction of the current is from south to north , the north pole of the needle will come to rest pointing west . Now , hold the compass above the wire . The needle will get deflected in the opposite direction . The direction of deflection will also change if you reverse the direction of the current in the wire by interchanging the battery connections . If you switch off the current in the wire , the needle will go back to its original position . Make sure that you pass a current through the wire only for short periods of time ( say , 5 seconds ) . Allowing current to pass through the wire for long will heat the wire considerably and also drain the battery rapidly ."

Since the angles of incidence and the angles of reflection are different , the parallel rays of light falling on a rough surface go in different directions ( see Figure 10 ) . Please note that the diffuse reflection of light is not due to the failure of the laws of reflection .

This will become more clear from the following discussion . The raindrops in the atmosphere act like many small prisms . As white sunlight enters and leaves these raindrops ( or water drops ) , the various coloured rays present in white light are refracted by different amounts due to which an arch of seven colours called rainbow is formed in the sky . The formation of rainbow can be explained with the help of a diagram shown in Figure 25 . A ray of white sunlight AB enters the raindrop at point B and undergoes refraction and dispersion to form a spectrum . This spectrum undergoes total internal reflection at point C within the raindrop and finally refracted out of the raindrop at point D ( see Figure 25 ) ."

Though the stick is actually straight but on immersing in water , it appears to be bent at point B , in the direction BI ( see Figure 10 ) . This can be explained as follows : A ray of light OC coming from the lower end O of the stick passes from water into air at point C and gets refracted away from normal in the direction CX ( because it passes from a denser medium water into a rarer medium air ) . Another ray of light OD gets refracted in the direction DY .

Even today , we are mainly dependent on the fossil fuels for our energy needs . If we continue to consume fossil fuels at such a rapid rate , they will soon get exhausted . And since fossil fuels , which we are using today , were formed very , very slowly over the past millions of years , so once exhausted they will not be available to us in the near future . This will create an energy crisis . In order to avoid running out of fossil fuels and face an energy crisis , we should explore alternative sources of energy which do not depend on the fuels dug out from the earth . This will help us conserve fossil fuels for a much longer time to come . Thus , we are looking at the alternative sources of energy because of the following reasons : ( i ) The fossil fuel reserves in the earth are limited which may get exhausted soon if continued to be used at the current rate , ( ii ) The use of alternative sources of energy will reduce pressure on fossil fuels making them last for a much longer time , and ( iii ) By using alternative sources of energy , the pollution being caused by the burning of fossil fuels can be avoided . Before we go further and study the alternative sources of energy , please answer the following questions :"

( b ) What would be the highest and the lowest equivalent resistances possible by joining these resistors ? EXAMPLE 18 Solution ( a ) As the equivalent resistance is 8 12 , the 12 - 12 resistor cannot be in series . So , it must be in parallel with some other resistors . In parallel connection , the equivalent resistance ( 892 ) has to be less than all the resistances . So , the resistors of 4 12 and 6 12 cannot be in parallel at one time with 12 12 . So , the resistors have to be in a mixed combination . Let us try the combination shown in Figure 4 . 67 . 122 The equivalent resistance of the resistors in parallel between B and C is 42 cm ( 692 ) x ( 12 12 ) – 40 . ( 612 ) + ( 1212 ) So , the resistance between A and D is Fig . 4 . W7 412 + 412 = 8 12 . Thus , the combination shown in the figure is correct .

The process of burning wood in insufficient supply of oxygen is called destructive distillation of wood . Wood is a mixture of carbon compounds like cellulose ( a carbohydrate ) , which decompose on heating . Most of the products formed escape , and what is left behind is mainly carbon , which is a better fuel than wood . You can prepare charcoal by heating wood shavings in a closed container that has a hole for gases to escape ."

Magnetic Field Pattern due to Straight Current - Carrying Conductor ( Straight Current - Carrying Wire ) The magnetic field lines around a straight conductor ( straight wire ) carrying current are concentric circles whose centres lie on the wire ( Figure Current 11 ) . In Figure 11 , we have a straight vertical wire ( or conductor ) AB which ( Upwards ) passes through a horizontal cardboard sheet C . The ends of the wire AB are connected to a battery through a switch . When current is passed through wire AB , it produces a magnetic field around it . This magnetic field has magnetic field lines around the wire AB which can be shown by sprinkling iron filings on the cardboard C . The iron filings get magnetised . And on tapping the cardboard sheet , the iron filings arrange themselves in circles Magnetic around the wire showing that the magnetic field lines are circular in nature . A small plotting compass M placed on the cardboard indicates the direction ( Anticlockwise ) | of the magnetic field . When current in the wire flows in the upward direction ( as shown in Figure 11 ) , then the lines of magnetic field are in the Figure 11 . Magnetic field anticlockwise direction . If the direction of current in the wire is reversed , the pattern due to a straight current - carrying wire . direction of magnetic field lines also gets reversed . It has been shown by experiments that the magnitude of magnetic field produced by a straight current carrying wire at a given point is : ( i ) directly proportional to the current passing in the wire , and ( ii ) inversely proportional to the distance of that point from the wire . So , greater the current in the wire , stronger will be the magnetic field produced . And greater the distance of a point from the current - carrying wire , weaker will be the magnetic field produced at that point . In fact , as we move away from a current carrying straight wire , the concentric circles around it representing magnetic field lines , become larger and larger indicating the decreasing strength of the magnetic field . field lines"

That depends on many things such as the purpose for which it is needed , available resources , etc . What is good for a village might not be suitable for a factory . For choosing a source of energy for a particular purpose , we evaluate the following characteristics . Energy output per unit volume The energy output per unit volume ( or mass ) of a good source of energy should be high . The gas in a 15 - kg LPG cylinder can be used by a family of average size to cook food for about a month . To cook the same amount of food using wood , you would need a roomful of wood . Clearly , the energy output per unit volume of LPG , which takes a small space in the kitchen , is much higher than that of wood . Steady availability The energy source should be available readily and for a long time . For example , coal and petroleum have been readily available for a long time . Although the sun is a good source of energy , it is available only during the day . Similarly , wind energy is reliable only in those places where there is always a wind . Safe and easy to use For widespread use , the source of energy has to be safe and easy to use . A fuel that produces a lot of smoke is not a good source of energy , since it is not safe for people ' s health . A nuclear power plant is not easy to build and operate . This limits the use of nuclear fuels like uranium . Easy to store and transport Most common sources of energy such as coal , petrol and LPG need to be transported to users from their points of production . They also need to be stored before use . We should be able to transport and store such sources of energy safely and economically . Economical The source of energy has to be economical . Hydrogen is an excellent fuel . But , it is not widely used as it is costly to produce , store and transport it ."

Now , a ray of light AO travelling in air is incident ( or falls ) obliquely on the glass slab at point O ( see Figure 2 ) . Since the glass slab is transparent , most of the incident light passes into the glass slab . Since glass is an optically denser medium than air , so when the ray of light AO passes from air into glass , its direction changes , it goes along the line OB inside the glass slab and we say that the light ray has been refracted ( or bent ) . This is because AO and OB are not in the same straight line . Please note that the refraction ( or bending ) of light takes place at the boundary between the two media .

This is called the heating effect of current . The heating effect of current is obtained by the transformation of electrical energy into heat energy . Just as mechanical energy used to overcome friction is converted into heat , in the same way , electrical energy is converted into heat energy when an electric current flows through a resistance wire . Thus , the role of ' resistance ' in electrical circuits is similar to the role of “ friction ' in mechanics . We will now derive a formula for calculating the heat produced when an electric current flows through a resistance wire . Since a conductor , say a resistance wire , offers resistance to the flow of current , so work must be done by the current int continuously to keep itself flowing . We will calculate the work"

In gensets , this is done by a small diesel engine . In the case of the dynamo of a bicycle , the rotating wheel rotates the shaft . In power stations , steam , water or wind falling on the blades of a turbine rotates the generator ' s shaft . As the coil rotates in the magnetic field , electricity is generated . When an electrical device is connected across the terminals of the generator , the circuit is completed and a current flows through the coil . If the terminals are left open , there is no current , but a potential difference appears between them . In Figure 5 . 21a , the brushes B1 and B2 are in contact with the halves Cį and C2 of the commutator respectively . B , is connected to the terminal P , and B2 is connected to the terminal Q . In the situation shown in Figure 5 . 21a , the arm AB of the coil is moving downwards , while the arm DC is moving upwards . Applying Fleming ' s left - hand rule , we find that the current in the coil flows along DCBA . Thus , the current flows through the bulb from P to Q . After half a rotation , the brushes with which the two halves of the commutator were in contact get interchanged ( Figure 5 . 21b ) . Now , the arm AB is moving upwards and the arm DC is moving downwards . This causes the current to flow along ABCD . The current through the bulb , however , remains from P to Q . This means that the terminal P always remains at a higher potential than Q , since a current flows from a higher to a lower potential . Note that although the direction of the current in the arms of the coil changes with each half - rotation , the commutator and - brush arrangement ensures that the current in the external circuit remains in the same direction . As long as the coil is rotating , a direct current flows through the device connected to the terminals of the generator ."

Please note that when the glass prism is kept on its base as shown in Figure 21 , then the red colour is at the top and violet colour is at the bottom of the spectrum . The splitting up of white light into seven colours on passing through a transparent medium like a glass prism is called dispersion of light . The formation of spectrum of seven colours shows that white light is made up of lights of seven different colours mixed together . That is , white light is a mixture of seven colours ( or seven coloured lights ) . The effect of glass prism is only to separate the seven colours of white light . A similar band of seven colours is produced when a beam of white light from an electric bulb falls on a triangular glass prism . We can explain the dispersion of light by a glass prism as follows ."

Now , the direction in which our fingers are folded gives the direction of magnetic field lines .

According to Maxwell ' s corkscrew rule : Imagine driving a corkscrew in the direction of current then the direction in which we turn its handle is the direction of magnetic field ( or magnetic field lines ) . The corkscrew rule is illustrated in Figure 13 . In Figure 13 , the direction of current is vertically downwards . Now , if we imagine driving the corkscrew downwards in the direction of current , then the handle of corkscrew is to be turned in the clockwise direction . So , the direction of magnetic field ( or magnetic field lines ) will also be in the clockwise direction . This example is opposite to the one we considered in right - hand thumb rule given above .

But this does not imply that fusion is a weaker source of energy than fission . The number of hydrogen nuclei in 1 gram of heavy hydrogen is much more than the number of U23 nuclei in 1 gram uranium . Therefore , the energy by the fusion of a certain mass of heavy hydrogen is much more than the energy released by the fission of equal mass of uranium .

It turns out that the heating effect of an AC voltage , whose peak value is Vo , is the same as that produced by a constant voltage of V . / 12 . This value is called its RMS voltage . When we say that the AC supply is at 220 V , we mean its RMS voltage is 220 V . The peak value of such a supply would be v2 x ( 220 V ) = 310 V ."

A medium in which the speed of light is more is known as optically rarer medium ( or less dense medium ) . Air is an optically rarer medium as compared to glass and water .

So , water is optically denser medium than air but it is optically rarer than glass . Please note that the refraction of light takes place whenever it goes from an optically rarer medium to an optically denser medium ; or from a denser medium to a rarer medium . The optically rarer medium and optically denser medium can also be defined on the basis of their refractive index . We will learn this after a while .

However , when the current is switched off , the magnetic field inside the solenoid becomes zero , and the bolt loses its magnetism . A magnet formed temporarily due to the magnetic field of a current is called an electromagnet . Electromagnets have the following properties . ( a ) Unlike a permanent magnet , the electromagnet ' s magnetism is not permanent . ( b ) The electromagnet has poles at its ends . However , the end at which a pole appears is not fixed . The poles get interchanged when the direction of current through the solenoid is changed . The iron used in nails , bolts , etc . , is a soft magnetic material , and is called soft iron . Such a material becomes magnetized in a magnetic field , but loses its magnetism once the field is removed . Electromagnets are made by winding wire over a core ( such as a rod ) made of a soft magnetic material .

The proper signs of the known values of u , v or f can be found by using New Cartesian Sign Convention for spherical mirrors . Another point to be noted is that the mirror formula can be applied to both type of spherical mirrors : concave mirrors as well as convex mirrors . By using this mirror formula , we can find out the position and nature of the images formed by concave mirrors and convex mirrors .

We say that its cells have become weak . What does it mean ? It means that the potential differences across the terminals of the cells have reduced . When you buy a new 1 . 5 - volt dry cell , the potential difference across its terminals is 1 . 5 V . When the cell is used for a long time , the potential difference drops to a smaller value , say , 0 . 75 V . When such a cell is used in a torch , less current flows through the bulb , and hence , it produces less light . So , we see that the electric current passing through an element depends on the potential difference applied across it . The larger is the potential difference , the larger is the current . This relationship between potential difference and current was first established by the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm ( 1787 – 1854 ) and is stated by the law named after him . Ohm ' s Law The current through a metallic element is proportional to the potential difference applied between its ends , provided the temperature remains constant .

Galvanometers and galvanoscopes are current - detecting instruments . While the needle of a galvanoscope deflects when a current passes through it , in a galvanometer , there is also an arrangement to measure the current passing through it . In one type of galvanometer , the needle stays at the zero mark at the middle when no current passes through it ( Figure 5 . 12a ) . When a current passes through it , the needle gets deflected . Unlike an ammeter , current may be passed in either direction through the galvanometer .

Here the electron beam is moving from our back wall to the front wall , so the direction of current will be in the opposite direction , from front wall towards back wall or towards us . The direction of deflection ( or force ) is towards our right side . We now know two things : ( i ) direction of current is from front towards us , and ( ii ) direction of force is towards our right side . Let us now hold the forefinger , centre finger and thumb of our left hand at right angles to one another . We now adjust the hand in such a way that our centre finger points towards us ( in the direction of current ) and thumb points towards right side ( in the direction of force ) . Now , if we look at our forefinger , it will be pointing vertically downwards . Since the direction of forefinger gives the direction of magnetic field , therefore , the magnetic field is in the vertically downward direction ."

The eye focuses on a given object by varying the shape of the pliable crystalline lens through an amazing process arus called accommodation . An important component in accommodation is the ciliary muscle , which is attached to the lens . When the eye is focused on distant objects , the ciliary muscle is relaxed . For an object distance of infinity , the focal length of the eye ( the distance between the lens and the retina ) is about 2 . 5 cm . The eye focuses on nearby objects by tensing the ciliary muscle . This action effectively decreases the focal length by slightly decreasing the radius of curvature of the lens , which allows the image to be focused on the retina . This lens adjustment takes place so swiftly that we are not even aware of the change . Again , in this respect , even the finest electronic camera is a toy , compared with the eye . It is evident that there is a limit to accommodation because objects that are very close to the eye produce blurred images . When we try to see objects lying nearby the ciliary muscles contract to increase the curvature of the lens . The thickness of the lens increases so that its focal length decreases and the image is again formed on the retina . This process of adjustment of the focal length is called accommodation . The power of accommodation of the eye is the maximum variation of its power for focusing nearby and distant objects . For a young person , the power of accommodation is about 4 dioptre ."

This increases the thickness of the crystalline lens and decreases the focal length of the eye - lens . This helps to form a sharp image on the retina . At a certain point near the eye , the ciliary muscles reach the limit of their contraction . If an object is brought closer still , the ciliary muscles cannot contract further . The closest point at which an object can be placed and seen clearly is called the near point of the eye . And , the distance of the closest point at which an object can be placed and seen clearly is called the least distance of distinct vision or the least distance of clear vision . When an object is placed at the near point ( that is , at a distance equal to the least distance of distinct vision ) , the curvature and thickness of the crystalline lens are maximum and the focal length of the eye - lens is minimum ( Figure 2 . 27b ) . The near point of the eye varies from person to person and with age . At a very young age ( below 10 years ) , the ciliary muscles are strong and flexible , and therefore , they can contract to a great extent . At this age , the near point may be as close as 7 to 8 cm from the eye . In old age , the ciliary muscles lose flexibility , and hence , the ability to contract to the required extent is lost . As a result , the near point recedes to 1 to 2 m , or even more . However , the standard value of the least distance of distinct vision for the normal human eye is taken as 25 centimetres .

NUCLEAR FISSION The word “ fission ' means to ' split up ' into two or more parts . The process in which the heavy nucleus of a radioactive atom ( such as uranium , plutonium or thorium ) splits up into smaller nuclei when bombarded with low energy neutrons , is called nuclear fission . A tremendous amount of energy is produced in the nuclear fission process . The sum of masses of the smaller nuclei formed in a fission reaction is a little less than that of the mass of the original heavy nucleus . So , there is a small loss of mass in the nuclear fission process which appears as a tremendous amount of energy . Please note that nuclear fission is carried out by bombarding the heavy nuclei with low energy neutrons which are also called slow moving neutrons . We will now give an example of a nuclear fission reaction . We will use the easily fissionable isotope of uranium called uranium - 235 in this example ."

The density of air in the atmosphere is not the same everywhere . In general , it is greatest at the earth ' s surface and goes on decreasing as we move higher . The refractive index of air depends on its density - higher the density of air , greater its refractive index . Under standard conditions of temperature , humidity , etc . , near the earth ' s surface , the refractive index of air is slightly greater than 1 . It decreases with height , and is very close to 1 in the outermost region of the atmosphere . The changes in refractive index of air give rise to many phenomena . For example , a rising current of hot air makes the objects viewed through it seem to flicker . You might have seen this happen as hot air rises above the heated surface of roads on hot summer days or above a large burning stove or chulha . Hot air has less density , and hence , less refractive index than normal or cold air . At a point in the area above a hot surface , the refractive index keeps on changing as currents of hot air passes through it . So , the amount by which light passing through it is bent keeps on changing . This makes the objects viewed through this area seem to sway or flicker . 1"

Figure 5 . 20b shows the position of the coil after half a rotation from the initial position . As a result of the rotation , the brushes with which the two halves of the commutator were in contact have got interchanged . This has reversed the battery connections to the two arms of the coil . Therefore , the current now flows along DCBA . That is , the direction of the current in the two arms of the coil has got reversed . Such a change takes place for each half - rotation . In this way , the commutator changes the direction of the current in the coil after each half - rotation . The two arms of the coil carry a current in a magnetic field . So , each arm experiences a force . The directions of the forces are shown by the grey arrows in the figure . In the position shown in Figure 5 . 20a , the arm AB experiences a downward force , while the arm CD experiences an upward force . This may be verified using Fleming ' s left - hand rule . The coil rotates in the anticlockwise direction because of these forces . After half a rotation , the direction of the current in the coil is reversed , as explained above . Using Fleming ' s left - hand rule , we find that the arm AB now experiences an upward force , and the arm CD experiences a downward force . So , the coil continues to rotate in the anticlockwise direction . If the commutator is not used , the direction of current in an arm of the coil will always remain the same .

The reflected rays DF and EC are produced backwards ( as shown by dotted lines ) . On producing backwards , they appear to intersect at point A ' behind the concave mirror . Thus , A ' is the virtual image of point A of the object . To get the complete image of the object we draw A ' B ' perpendicular to the axis from point A ' . Thus A ' B ' is the image of the object AB formed by the concave mirror . Now , an eye at position X , sees the reflected rays as if they have come from points A ' B ' behind the mirror . Since there is no actual intersection of the reflected rays , so the image A ' B ' is a virtual image . This image can be seen only by looking into the concave mirror , it cannot be obtained on a screen . We can see from Figure 33 that the image is same side up as object ( both of them have arrow - head at the top ) , so it is an erect image . And if we compare the size of the object AB and its image A ' B ' , the image appears to be bigger in size than the object . Thus , it is an enlarged image or magnified image . From the above discussion we conclude that : When an object is placed between the pole ( P ) and focus ( F ) of a concave mirror , the image formed is : ( i ) behind the mirror , ( ii ) virtual and erect , and ( iii ) larger than the object ( or magnified ) ."

The blue sky , green leaves , red roses , yellow sunflowers , colourful birds and butterflies , etc . , are just some of the colours we see in nature . And then we have the colours of our clothes , pens , pencils , houses , vehicles , and so on . The colours we see depend on the colour of light entering our eyes from an object or a source of light . Different sources of light may produce lights of different colours . A sodium - vapour lamp , for example , produces a yellowish light . The flame of a gas stove emits blue light . But sunlight does not appear to have a colour . The same is true of certain types of bulbs we use at home . We call such light ( i . e . , those that appear colourless ) white light . Though white light does not appear coloured , it is actually a mixture of lights of different colours present in a definite proportion . Lights of different colours have different wavelengths . So , they behave differently . For example , they travel at different speeds in any material medium . This makes the refractive index of a transparent material slightly different for different colours of lights . So , lights of different colours bend by different amounts on refraction . Therefore , under certain conditions , when white light gets refracted , its components bend by different amounts and separate out . You must have seen this happen when sunlight passing through a glass of water falls on the table or the floor , producing a band of colours . The phenomenon of splitting of light into its component colours due to the dependence of refractive index on wavelength is called the dispersion of light ."

We know that a thick wire has a greater area of cross - section whereas a thin wire has a smaller area of cross - section . This means that a thick wire has less resistance , and a thin wire has more resistance . A thick wire ( having large area of cross - section ) can be considered equivalent to a large number of thin wires connected in parallel .

Dentists use concave mirrors to see the large image of the teeth for examining the teeth of a person ( see Figure 34 ( c ) ] . For this purpose , the dentist holds a small concave mirror in such a way that the tooth lies within its focus . A magnified image of the tooth is then seen by the dentist in the concave mirror . Since the tooth looks much bigger , it becomes easy to examine the defect in the tooth ."

A tremendous amount of energy is produced during the fusion process . We know that the nuclei of atoms are positively charged . So , when two nuclei are brought together , they repel each other due to their similar charges . Due to this a lot of initial heat energy and high pressure are required to force the lighter nuclei to fuse together to form a bigger nucleus . So , the conditions needed for carrying out nuclear fusion process are ' millions of degrees of temperature ' and ' millions of pascals of pressure ' . In other words , nuclear fusion is carried out by heating the lighter atoms to extremely high temperatures under extremely high pressure . There is some loss of mass during the fusion process which appears as a tremendous amount of energy . Here is an example of nuclear fusion reaction ."

Connect the circuit as shown in Figure 4 . 11a , using one cell . The plug key allows you to switch off the current when not required . The wire becomes quite hot when current passes through it for some time . This drains the cell as well . Therefore , insert the key into the plug to switch on the current only when taking measurements . The ammeter measures the current i through the circuit , and the voltmeter measures the potential difference V between the ends A and B of the wire . Note these values . Now connect two cells in series in the circuit , as shown in Figure 4 . 11b . You will find that the reading of the voltmeter increases , indicating the fact that a larger potential difference has been applied across the wire AB . You will also find that the reading of the ammeter increases as well . Note down the new values of V and i . Repeat the experiment by connecting in series three celis , four cells , and so on . In each case measure the potential difference and the current . If you calculate V / i for each , you will find that it is almost the same . So , V / i = R is a constant , which is another way of stating Ohm ' s law . Here , Ris the resistance of the wire AB . If you plot a graph of the current i against the potential difference V , it will be a straight line ( Figure 4 . 11c ) . This shows that the current is proportional to the potential difference .

It is called so because if , by convention , we always keep the object to the left of the pole and above the principal axis , the signs of the quantities u , v , f and r follow the same rules followed for representing the x - coordinates of points using coordinate axes . You can think of the pole as the origin , the principal axis as the x - axis and a line perpendicular to it as the y - axis . The left - to - right direction is taken as the positive direction of the x - axis . Then you can think of u , v , f and r as the x - coordinates of the object , image , focus and centre of curvature respectively . Thus , if any of these is to the left of the pole ( origin ) , its x - coordinate is negative . Similarly , if any of these is to the right of the pole , its x - coordinate is positive .

This is termed as the magnetic force . The region itself is termed as the magnetic field of the magnet .

Some of the air layers of the atmosphere are cold whereas other air layers of the atmosphere are comparatively warm ( or hotter ) .

Light that reaches us , travels through this atmosphere / air and is modified by it . The Earth ' s atmosphere is not uniform . Under most conditions the density of the atmosphere decreases with increasing height from the surface . The refractive index depends on the density of a gas because the less dense the gas , the more like a vacuum it becomes . Refraction occurs whenever there is any change in the refractive index . When there is an abrupt change as at the surface of glass , the change in the direction of the light is abrupt . But when the change is gradual , the path of a light ray is a gentle curve . The gradual increase in the refractive index as light travels into the lower atmosphere means that light from celestial objects such as the Sun , Moon , and stars bend towards the normal as it travels from an optically rarer into an optically denser medium . This difference of refractive index amongst the various layers of the atmosphere gives rise to some spectacular phenomenon . Some of these phenomena are illustrated below ."

Please note that a good conductor of electricity should have a low resistivity and a poor conductor of electricity will have a high resistivity . From the above table we find that of all the metals , silver has the lowest resistivity ( of 1 . 60 x 10 - 8 22 m ) , which means that silver offers the least resistance to the flow of current through it . Thus , silver metal is the best conductor of electricity . It is obvious that we should make electric wires of silver metal . But silver is a very costly metal . We use copper and aluminium wires for the transmission of electricity because copper and aluminium have very low resistivities ( due to which they are very good conductors of electricity ) . From this discussion we conclude that silver , copper and aluminium are very good conductors of electricity ."

The rest of the answer to this puzzle is in the way our vision works . We have three types of colour receptors , or cones , in our retina . They are called red , blue and green because they respond most strongly to light at those wavelengths . As they are stimulated in different proportions our visual system constructs the colours we see . When we look up at the sky the red cones respond to the small amount of scattered red light and also less strongly to orange and yellow wavelengths . The green cones respond to yellow and the more strongly scattered green and green - blue wavelengths . The blue cones are stimulated by colours near blue wavelengths which are very strongly scattered . If there were no indigo and violet in the spectrum the sky would appear blue with a slight green tinge . However , the most strongly scattered indigo and violet wavelengths stimulate the red cones slightly as well as the blue , which is why these colours appear blue with an added red tinge . The net effect is that the red and green cones are stimulated about equally by the light from the sky while the blue is stimulated more strongly . This combination accounts for the pale sky blue colour ."

It should have a high calorific value . In other words , an ideal fuel ( or good fuel ) is that which gives us more heat per unit mass . 2 . It should burn without giving out any smoke or harmful gases . That is , an ideal fuel ( or good fuel ) is that which does not pollute air on burning by giving out smoke or poisonous gases . 3 . It should have a proper ignition temperature , so that it can be burned easily . The ignition temperature of an ideal fuel ( or good fuel ) should neither be too low nor too high . Because if the ignition temperature of the fuel is very low , then the fuel will catch fire too easily and hence it will be very unsafe to use it . On the other hand , if the ignition temperature is too high , then it will be very difficult to light the fuel . 4 . It should be cheap and easily available .

Reverse the spoon and repeat the activity . How does the image look like now ? • Compare the characteristics of the image on the two surfaces . DISCUSSION : The shining spoon acts as a good reflector of light . Since it is curved , therefore , it behaves as a spherical mirror . Its inner surface behaves as a concave mirror and its outer surface behaves as a convex mirror . When we view our face in it , it acts as a mirror . When our face is very close to the spoon , it lies between the pole P and focus F of this concave mirror . Hence , we observe an enlarged , erect image of our face . When we move the spoon slowly away from our face , we observe that ; • When face is at focus of spoon , highly enlarged , inverted image of our face is seen at infinity . • When face is between F and C of spoon , an enlarged , inverted image of our face is seen . When face is at the centre of curvature of the spoon , an inverted image of same size is seen . When it is between F and C , an inverted and diminished image of our face is seen . • When the face is very far off , highly diminished , inverted image of our face is seen at the focus of spoon On reversing , the spoon behaves like a convex mirror .

The image , however , continues to be virtual , erect and finally , it is diminished to almost point size ."

These bulbs are connected in series , and the mains voltage is applied to the combination . The potential difference ( V ) of the mains gets divided across the bulbs ( V = V1 + V2 + V2 + . . . ) . So , a small potential difference exists across each bulb , close to that required to make the bulb work . However , the same current flows through all the bulbs . So , if one bulb goes bad , the current through it stops , and this stops the current through the rest of the bulbs as well . To make the chain of lights work , you have to find and replace the defective bulb . This problem does not occur with the lights in your house .

If you are looking at a cloud , the object - distance is large . If you are looking at your finger , the object - distance is small . To form clear and sharp images of both at the same distance from the lens , the focal length of the eye - lens has to change . As you know , the ciliary muscles can change the focal length of the eye - lens . When we are looking at a distant object ( usually farther than 6 m ) , the ciliary muscles are in their most relaxed state . Then the focal length of the eye - lens is such that rays coming from the distant object are focused on the retina , and we see the object clearly ( Figure 2 . 26a ) . When we are looking at a nearby object , the ciliary muscles contract to increase the curvature of the crystalline lens . The thickness of this lens increases , which decreases its focal length ( and therefore , the focal length of the eye - lens ) . The ciliary muscles adjust the focal length in such a manner that a sharp image is formed on the retina ( Figure 2 . 26b ) . This process of adjustment of the focal length of the eye - lens is called accommodation . Accommodation is the process by which the eye changes the focal length of the eye - lens such that a sharp image is always formed on the retina ."

In Figure 1 . 7d , a ray AB , parallel to the principal axis , is incident on a convex mirror . The ray is reflected along BD . When BD is produced backwards , it intersects the principal axis at F . For a convex mirror of small aperture , all rays incident parallel to the principal axis , when produced backwards after reflection , appear to diverge from this same point F . A convex mirror is therefore also called a diverging mirror . We can now define focus and focal length of a spherical mirror as follows . The point on the principal axis where rays incident parallel to the principal axis converge to or appear to diverge from after reflection is called the focus of the spherical mirror . The distance of the focus from the pole is called the focal length of the spherical mirror .

Actually , the term "" calorific value ” comes from the fact that the earlier unit of measurement of heat was calorie . These days , although we mostly use joule as the unit of heat but the term calorific value continues to be used as such . If we look up the table of calorific values , we will find that hydrogen gas has the highest calorific value of 150 kilojoules per gram . Thus , because of its high calorific value , hydrogen is an extremely good fuel . Most of the common fuels are the compounds of hydrogen and carbon called “ hydrocarbons ' .

A line such that the tangent at any point on it gives the direction of the magnetic field at that point is called a magnetic field line or magnetic line of force .

Remember that the field lines are imaginary . They just help us visualize magnetic fields . 2 . You can see magnetic field lines with the help of iron filings too . Place a glass or clear plastic sheet over a bar magnet . Sprinkle some iron filings over the sheet , and gently tap the sheet . The iron filings will arrange themselves to show the magnetic field lines ( Figure 5 . 2c ) . You can make the following observations about magnetic field lines from Figure 5 . 2b . ( a ) All field lines are closed curves . They come out of the magnet from the side of the north pole and go into it on the side of the south pole . They continue inside the magnet too . Although we cannot draw the lines inside the magnet , we know about them from other observations . ( b ) The field lines are close together near the poles and spread out away from them . The field is stronger where the field lines are more closely spaced . So , the field is stronger near the poles than at other points . ( c ) The field lines never intersect .

And the neutral wire is also maintained at almost zero potential . Current enters an appliance through the live wire and returns through the neutral wire . An appliance that consumes relatively low power , e . g . , a tube light or a fan , has just two terminals . Using them , the appliance is connected across the live and neutral wires . Appliances such as heaters , electric irons , refrigerators , etc . , have a third terminal , called the earth terminal . This terminal is connected to the metallic body of the appliance .

The direction of the magnetic field due to a magnet at a point near it can be found by placing a magnetic compass at that point . The compass needle comes to rest along a particular direction . The direction of the magnetic field at the point is the direction from the south pole to the north pole of the needle . When a magnetic compass is kept at a place which is away from all magnets , its needle comes to rest along the north - south direction . This means that the direction of the magnetic field there is from the south to the north . This field is produced by the earth . The magnetic field of the earth also affects a compass needle placed near a magnet . The direction of the compass needle gives the direction of the net magnetic field due to the bar magnet and the earth .

The exploitation of coal as a source of energy made the industrial revolution possible . When coal is burnt , the carbon present in coal reacts with the oxygen of air to form carbon dioxide . A lot of heat is produced during the burning of coal which makes it a good fuel . The burning of coal , however , produces a lot of smoke which pollutes the air . When coal is subjected to destructive distillation ( by heating strongly in the absence of air ) , then all the volatile material is removed from coal and coke is formed . Coke is 98 % carbon . Coke is a better fuel than coal because it produces more heat ( than an equal mass of coal ) , and it does not produce smoke while burning . Thus , burning of coke does not cause air pollution ."

In other words , each magnetic field line is directed from the north pole of a magnet to its south pole . Each field line indicates , at every point on it , the direction of magnetic force that would act on a north pole if it were placed at that point . The strength of magnetic field is indicated by the degree of closeness of the field lines . Where the field lines are closest together , the magnetic field is the strongest . For example , the field lines are closest together at the two poles of the bar magnet , so the magnetic field is the strongest at the poles . Please note that no two magnetic field lines are found to cross each other . If two field lines crossed each other , it would mean that at the point of intersection , the compass needle would point in two directions at the same time , which is not possible .

They discovered that certain stones , now called magnetite ( Fe304 ) , attract pieces of iron . The Chinese called it the lodestone i . e . , the leading stone . Legend ascribes the name magnetite to the shepherd Magnes , the nails of whose shoes and the tip of whose staff stuck fast in a magnetic field while he pastured his flocks ” . In 1269 Pierre de Maricourt , using a spherical natural magnet , mapped out the directions taken by a needle when placed at various points on the surface of the sphere . He found that , the directions formed lines that encircle the sphere passing through two points , diametrically opposite to each other , which he called the poles of the magnet . Subsequent experiments showed that every magnet , regardless of its shape , has two poles , called north and south poles , which exhibit forces on each other in a manner analogous to electrical charges . That is , like poles repel each other and unlike poles attract each other ."

The ciliary muscles contract and relax to change the overall focal length of the eye - lens so that sharp images of objects at different distances are formed on the retina . This process is called accommodation . The retina has millions of receptors known as rods and cones . These receptors pass image information to the brain via an optic nerve connected to each eye . Rods are more numerous and work in dim light also . Cones gather information about colour and details , and need good light to work . The farthest point up to which the eye can see properly is called the far point of the eye . The closest point at which an object can be placed and seen clearly is called the near point .

The neutrons produced in a fission process cause further fission of the heavy nuclei leading to a self - sustaining chain reaction . When all the neutrons produced during fission of uranium - 235 are allowed to cause further fission , then so much energy is produced in a very short time that it cannot be controlled and leads to an explosion called atom bomb . We can , however , control a nuclear fission reaction by using control rods made of boron . Boron has a property that it can absorb neutrons . So , when a nuclear fission reaction is carried out in the presence of boron rods , the excess neutrons produced during successive fissions of uranium - 235 atoms are absorbed by boron rods and hence not available to cause further fission . Due to this a controlled fission reaction of uranium - 235 takes place liberating heat energy at a slow , steady and manageable rate which can be used for generating electricity at a nuclear power plant ."

At the centre of the circular loop , the magnetic field lines are straight ( see point M in Figure 14 ) . By applying right hand thumb rule , it can be seen that each segment of circular loop carrying current produces magnetic field lines in the same direction within the loop . At the centre of the circular loop , all the magnetic field lines are in the same direction and aid each other , due to which the strength of magnetic field increases ."

In activity 2 , you have seen that the sharp bright spot of light you got on the paper is , in fact , the image of the Sun . It was a tiny , real , inverted image . You got the approximate focal length of the concave mirror by measuring the distance of the image from the mirror . Take a concave mirror . Find out its approximate focal length in the way described above . Note down the value of focal length . ( You can also find it out by obtaining image of a distant object like a tree or window on a sheet of paper ) . Mark a line on a table with a chalk . Place the concave mirror on a stand . Place the stand over the line such that its pole lies over the line . • Draw with a chalk two more lines parallel to the previous line such that the distance between any two successive lines is equal to the focal length of the mirror . These lines will now correspond to the positions of the points P , F and C , respectively . Remember - For a spherical mirror of small aperture , the principal focus F lies midway between the pole P and the centre of curvature C . Keep a bright object , say a burning candle , at a position far beyond C . Place a paper screen and move it in front of the mirror till you obtain a sharp bright image of the candle flame on it . Observe the image carefully . Note down its nature , position and relative size with respect to the object size . Repeat the activity by placing the candle ( a ) just beyond C , ( b ) at C , ( c ) between F and C , ( d ) at F , and ( e ) between P and F . In one of the cases , you may not get the image on the screen . Identify the position of the object in such a case . Then , look for its virtual image in the mirror itself . • Note down and tabulate your observations . DISCUSSION : Hold the concave mirror in your hand and point its reflecting surface towards a distant object , say a tree . Hold the cardboard screen in the other hand in front of the concave mirror . Move the screen back and forth till a sharp image of the distant object / tree is seen on the screen . Measure the distance of screen from the mirror . This distance is the approximate focal length of concave mirror . Mark a line on a table with a chalk . Place the concave mirror on a stand at this point . This position of the mirror is its pole P . With a chalk , draw two more lines parallel to the previous line such that the distance between any two successive lines is approximately the focal length of the mirror . The line closer to P represents principal focus F and that away from P , the centre of curvature C of the mirror . When we keep a bright object such as a burning candle at a position far beyond C , and move back and forth a paper screen in front of the mirror , we get a sharp bright image of the candle flame on the screen . As the candle is moved from a point just beyond C towards the pole of the concave mirror , the image moves from the focus towards the centre of curvature , increasing in size from a point size at the focus to the same size as the object , at the centre of curvature . As the object moves further towards the focus , the image moves towards infinity , increasing in size and always remaining real and inverted . When the object is at the focus , the image is formed at infinity . When the object is moved closer the image becomes virtual and is formed behind the mirror . Therefore , no image is seen when the candle lies between the pole of the mirror and its focus . The ray diagrams of these positions are depicted in figure 4 . 15 through 4 . 20 . These results are as shown in Table 4 . 1 ."

If an object is placed away from the principal axis , u corresponds to the distance from the pole to the foot of the perpendicular drawn from the object to the principal axis . Similarly , v corresponds to the distance from the pole to the foot of the perpendicular drawn from the image to the principal axis . The quantities h , and he are defined for a linear , extended object placed perpendicular to the principal axis . For finding a particular distance when some others are given , we need to assign these quantities ( u , v , f , r , ho , he ) positive or negative signs according to a fixed set of rules , or a convention . Several conventions for the signs of these quantities are in use . We shall follow the Cartesian coordinates convention The sign convention for the distances parallel to the principal axis is as follows . Coordinate Convention for u , v , f , r • u , v , f and r are measured from the pole . • If a distance is measured along the incident rays , the corresponding quantity is positive . If a distance is measured opposite to the incident rays , the corresponding quantity is negative . For example , in Figure 1 . 16a , the rays are incident from the left to the right .

Thus , when a number of resistances are connected in parallel then their combined resistance is less than the smallest individual resistance . This is due to the fact that when we have two or more resistances joined parallel to one another , then the same current gets additional paths to flow and the overall resistance decreases . Before we derive a formula for the resultant resistance of a number of resistances connected in parallel , we should keep in mind that : ( i ) When a number of resistances are connected in parallel , then the potential difference across each resistance is the same which is equal to the voltage of the battery applied . ( ii ) When a number of resistances connected in parallel are joined to the two terminals of a battery , then different amounts of current flow through each resistance ( which depends on the value of resistance ) . But the current flowing through all the individual parallel resistances , taken together , is equal to the current flowing in the circuit as a whole .

So , when we go out from a dark room into bright sunlight or switch on a bright lamp , a large amount of light enters our eyes and we feel the glare . Gradually , the pupil of our eye contracts . Less light then enters our eye and we can see clearly . In this way , the iris also protects our eyes from the glare of bright lights ."

The magnetic field produced by a current carrying solenoid is shown in Figure 16 . The magnetic field produced by a current - carrying solenoid is similar to the magnetic field produced by a bar magnet . Please note that the lines of magnetic field pass through the solenoid and return to the other end as shown in Figure 16 . The magnetic field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of parallel straight lines . This indicates that the strength of magnetic field is the same at all the points inside the solenoid .

Place a rectangular glass slab over the sheet in the middle . Draw the outline of the slab with a pencil . Let us name the outline as ABCD . Take four identical pins . . Fix two pins , say E and F , vertically such that the line joining the pins is inclined to the edge AB . • Look for the images of the pins E and F through the opposite edge , CD . Fix two other pins , say G and H , such that these pins and the images of E and F lie on a straight line . • Remove the pins and the slab . Join the positions of tip of the pins E and F and produce the line up to AB . Let EF meet AB at 0 . Similarly , join the positions of tip of the pins G and H and produce it up to the edge CD .

Since the ray moves from an optically rarer to an optically denser medium , therefore , it bends towards the normal NN ' and travels towards point O ' . At O ' , this light ray enters air ( optically rarer ) from glass ( optically denser ) , therefore , it bends away from normal MM ' . This is second refraction , When a ray light is passing from air to glass , that is , from a rarer medium to a denser medium , the refracted ray bends towards the normal drawn at the point of incidence . In this case Zi > Zr . But when the ray of light is passing from glass to air , that is , from a denser medium to a rarer medium the refracted ray bends away from the normal . In this Zr > Zi ."

From the humble torch to the powerful computer , thousands of things we use every day need electricity to work . The source of all electricity is charge . As charge is the basis of all electrical phenomena , we often need to know the amount of charge on a body . It is measured in coulombs . The coulomb is the SI unit of charge and its symbol is C . As you know , matter is generally made of protons , electrons and neutrons . Each proton carries a charge of 1 . 6 x 10 - 19 coulomb , and each electron carries an equal negative charge . Neutrons do not carry any net charge . Normally , a body has equal number of protons and electrons , and is therefore , electrically neutral . However , in certain situations , the balance of charges in a body is disturbed . For example , when a glass rod is rubbed with a silk cloth , some electrons get transferred from the glass rod to the silk . The silk cloth , which gains electrons , becomes negatively charged . And the glass rod , which is left with more protons than electrons , becomes positively charged . Charged particles or objects can exert forces on each other . While like ( similar ) charges repel each other , unlike charges attract . Another important thing about charged particles is that they can flow , i . e . , they can move in a particular direction . This flow of charged particles is called an electric current . Charged particles such as electrons are present in all substances . But , they do not flow on their own . For flow of charges , there has to be a potential difference ."

First of all we should know why we use a thin wire as a fuse wire and not a thick wire . We use a thin wire in a fuse because it has a much greater resistance than the rest of connecting wires . Due to its high resistance , the heating effect of current will be much more in the fuse wire than anywhere else in the circuit . This will melt the fuse wire whereas other wiring will remain safe . We should not use a thick wire as a fuse wire because it will have a low resistance and hence it will not get heated to its melting point easily . The fuse wire is usually made from tin - plated copper wire having low melting point so that it may melt easily . A pure copper wire cannot be used as a fuse wire because it has a high melting point due to which it will not melt easily when a short circuit takes place ."

This resistance is called the equivalent resistance of the combination , and its value is given by Ohm ' s law as Req = V / i ."

The electrons , however , are not completely free to move in a conductor . When the electrons move from one part of the conductor to the other part , they collide with other electrons and with the positive ions ( protons ) present in the conductor . These collisions slow down the speed of electrons . This property of the conductor by virtue of which it opposes the flow of electrons ( electric current ) through it is called electric resistance . In this activity , every conductor , i . e . nichrome wire , torch bulb , 10 W bulb offered resistance to the electric current but to a different extent . So , we observed that the current flowing through the circuit was different for different components ."
