before we solve problems involving direction of current . direction of magnetic field and the direction of force by using fleming s left hand rule . we should keep the following points in mind i by convention . the direction of flow of positive charges is taken to be the direction of flow of current . so . the direction in which the positively charged particles such as protons or alpha particles . etc . . move will be the direction of electric current . ii the direction of electric current is . however . taken to be opposite to the direction of flow of negative charges such as electrons . so . if we are given the direction of flow of electrons . then the direction of electric current will be taken as opposite to the direction of flow of electrons . iii the direction of deflection of a current carrying conductor or a stream of positively charged particles or a stream of negatively charged particles like electrons tells us the direction of force acting on it . let us solve some problems now .
sources of geothermal energy . the geothermal energy is harnessed as follows 
wind energy definition flow of air is called wind . it possesses enormous energy . as the energy is due to motion of air during its flow . the energy is kinetic . source of wind energy solar energy heats the entire earth but the heating is not uniform . the heating is more intense near the equator than in the polar region . this makes air in the equator region more hot and light . it rises up and its space is filled with the cooler air from polar region . in this way air flows from colder region at high pressure to hotter region at low pressure . the flow of air from one place to other constitutes wind . the smooth flow of air is disturbed continuously by rotation of the earth as well as by the local conditions . due to these interacting factor the wind speed may vary from km h to about km h gentle breeze to very high speed of about km h of a storm tornado .

images formed by convex lenses figure . shows a typical case of image formation by a convex lens . ab is an object placed perpendicular to the principal axis of a convex lens . to locate the image of the point b . we draw two rays . bd and bo . the ray bd is parallel to the principal axis and passes through the focus f after transmission through the lens . the ray bo passes through the optical centre and is transmitted without deviation . the transmitted rays df and ob intersect at b . which is the image of b . if we draw a perpendicular b a to the principal axis . a will be the image of a . thus . a b is the image of ab . in the case shown in figure . . the image a b is real . fig . . table . shows the ray diagrams for several cases of image formation by a convex lens . the object ab is placed perpendicular to the principal axis . the distance of of is the focal length f . in the figures of this table . f . denotes a point on the same side as f . at a distance f from o . similarly . f . denotes a point on the side of f . . at a distance f from o . central line a description in a . the object is at infinity . so . the incident rays are parallel . the transmitted rays meet at the focus f . where a point sized . real image is formed . as the object is brought closer . the image moves away from the lens . and its size starts increasing from the point sized image formed at the focus . the image is real and inverted . but as long as the object is beyond f . the size of the image is less than that of the object . this is shown in b . when the object is at f . i . e . . at a distance f from the lens . the image is formed at the same distance on the other side . at f . this image is of the same size as the object . this is shown in c . when the object is between f . and fj . the image forms beyond f . and its size is larger than that of the object . this is shown in d . what happens when the object is at the focus f the ray diagram is shown in e . the rays coming from b become parallel after transmission . we can say that the transmitted rays intersect at infinity . and hence . form a real image . also . this image is below the principal axis . thus . the image of ab is said to be inverted . real and infinitely large . however . to the eye in the path of the transmitted rays . the rays appear to be coming from a point at infinity on the side of incident rays . therefore . from the observer s point of view . the image is virtual . erect and infinitely large . if the object is placed between f and o . i . e . . within the focal length . a virtual . erect and enlarged image is formed . as shown in f .
we will discuss about these two kinds of spherical mirrors and learn how to use the laws of reflection to locate the images that such mirrors produce . a number of applications of these mirrors will also be presented .
and the input is called the useful energy . one of the characteristics which a fuel must possess is that the output of the fuel should be greater than the input . while searching for a good fuel we must ask ourselves the following questions i does the fuel produce enough heat ii is its output greater than its input iii does it produce a lot of smoke iv is it easily available v is it economical

 Ð² spherical mirrors spherical mirrors are the part of spherical reflecting surfaces . they are made from hollow glass spheres . if a portion of the hollow sphere is cut along a plane and silvered . it serves as a spherical mirror . if the portion apb as shown in figure . is silvered such that the depressed surface b becomes the reflecting surface then it is called concave spherical mirror . concave mirror convex mirror on the other hand . if the silvering is done so that the surface bulging outwards serves as the reflecting surface . then it is called convex spherical mirror .
blind spot the point where optic nerve enters the eye ball is called blind spot . it has no nerve endings . it is the area on the retina which does not have light sensitive cells rods and cones . so if the image is formed on this part . then no signal is sent to the brain . as a result object is not visible to the eye .

a fuse used must be of current capacity also called current rating less than the maximum current which a circuit or an appliance can withstand . a fuse of current capacity of a is put in a line meant to supply power to lights i . e . . bulbs and fans whereas a fuse of a current capacity is meant for a line which operates an electric heater or a geyser . etc .
take a thick straight conductor copper wire xy and pass it through the centre o of a thick cardboard . connect it through the rheostat rn . a key k and an ammeter a so that the current flows from y to x as shown in figure a . when we sprinkle some iron filings on the cardboard . these iron filings arrange themselves in concentric circles around . when the cardboard is gentle tapped . these concentric circles represent the magnetic field lines . this shows that there exists a magnetic field around a straight current carrying conductor and it is in the form of concentric circular field lines with the conductor at the centre . in other words to know the direction of the magnetic field . we plot the field lines with the help of a compass needle . the north pole of the compass points in the direction of the field at any point . the direction of these field lines is anticlockwise as shown figure b .
electric fuse a safety device an electric fuse is a device which is used in series to limit the current in an electric circuit so that it easily melts due to overheating when excessive current passes through it . a fuse is a wire of a material with very low melting point .

 s pole . so . if a current carrying solenoid is suspended freely . it will come to rest pointing in the north and south directions just like a freely suspended bar magnet . we can determine the north and south poles of a current carrying solenoid by using a bar magnet . this can be done as follows we bring the north pole of a bar magnet near both the ends of a current carrying solenoid . the end of solenoid which will be repelled by the north pole of bar magnet will be its north pole . and the end of solenoid which will be attracted by the north pole of bar magnet will be its south pole .
 ii strong field magnets two concave poles ns of permanent magnets between which the armature coil is rotated . iii slip rings the two ends of the coil are welded to two different circular metallic rings r . and rg . these rings are called the slip rings . the function of the slip rings is to ensure the flow of current flowing through the coil after each half rotation . iv brushes two carbon brushes b . and b . make a contact with the slip rings r . and r .
i fig . . you will find that the current i gets divided into the branches such that s i . iz . so . the total current flowing into the combination is equal to the sum of the currents passing through the individual resistors . note that in the activity all the resistors are connected between the common points a and b . the potential difference between the points is va vb . this potential difference exists across each resistor . if resistors are connected in such a way that the same potential difference gets applied to each der er en del of them . they are said to be connected in parallel .
tyndall effect the phenomenon of scattering of light by dust . smoke and tiny water droplets suspended in air is known as tyndall effect .
when a pencil is partly immersed in water and held obliquely to the surface . the pencil appears to bend at the water surface when viewed from the side see figure . this apparent bending of the pencil is due to the refraction of light when it passes from water into air . we can use figure for explaining the bending of pencil in water . just make a pencil in place of stick .
into view the objects which are actually below the horizon and cannot be seen otherwise . this happens in the case of the sun just before sunrise and just after sunset . thus . we can see the sun about minutes before the actual sunrise and minutes after the actual sunset because of atmospheric refraction . let us take the case of sunrise .
fleming s left hand rule sir john ambrose fleming . an english engineer and professor . suggested a simple rule for finding the direction of the force experienced by a current carrying wire placed in a magnetic field that is perpendicular to the current in the wire . if the forefinger . second finger and thumb of the left hand are stretched at right angles to each other . with the forefinger in the direction of the field and the second finger in the direction of the current then the thumb indicates the direction of the force . you can remember this rule as follows . the words field . current and movement of the wire start with the letters f . c and m respectively . the words forefinger . second and thumb have these letters in them . so . field is shown by the forefinger . current by the second finger . and movement by the thumb . obviously . the movement of the wire denotes the force on it .

 . let us move the wire ab upwards rapidly between the poles of the horseshoe magnet see figure a . when the wire is moved up . there is a deflection in the galvanometer pointer showing that a current is produced in the wire ab momentarily which causes the deflection in galvanometer see figure a . the deflection lasts only while the wire is in motion . thus . as the wire is moved up through the magnetic field . an electric current is produced in it .

cooker cannot be used to cook those foods where strong heating is required . for example . the box type solar cooker cannot be used for baking chapattis . etc . and for frying because they require stronger heating . in order to achieve higher temperatures required for baking and frying . spherical reflector type solar cooker having a concave reflector is used . when a concave mirror reflector is attached to a solar cooker . it converges
right side of object appears to become the left side of image and the left side of object appears to become the right side of image . this change of sides of an object and its mirror image is called lateral inversion . the phenomenon of lateral inversion will become clear from the following example . suppose we have a placard having the word red written on it as shown in figure a . when we hold this placard in front of a plane mirror . the image of word red appears to be like as as shown in figure b . please note that the object placard has the letter r on its left side but image has this letter in reversed form i on its right side . similarly . the image of letter e appears to be reversed like . and the letter d on the right side of the object placard is on the left side of the image in the reversed form as a . thus . all the letters written on the placard are reversed from left to right . we say that the image is laterally inverted .

the neutral and the ground wires are at the same potential as that of the earth at the local substation i . e . . they are at zero potential . before the electric line is connected to the energy meter in the house it is made to pass through a high rating fuse of about a called the pole fuse . the three wires are then connected to the company energy meter . through which they are connected to the main switch .
choroid it starts below the sclerotic . it is grey black layer of tissues and its function is to keep the eye dark by absorbing diffused light falling on it and to avoid internal reflections within the eye .
an electric current produces a magnetic field activity a magnet is not the only thing that produces a magnetic field . an electric current in a conductor also produces a magnetic field . this was first observed in by the danish physicist hans christian oersted . the magnetic effect of electric current can be very easily be demonstrated by bringing a magnetic compass near a current carrying wire . the compass needle gets deflected . showing that a magnetic field is produced near the wire . place a magnetic compass on a wooden or plastic block . away from all magnetic material . when the compass needle comes to rest . fix a wire over the compass . parallel to the needle . connect the wire to a battery through a switch . as shown in figure . a . close the switch to pass a current through the wire . the compass needle will get deflected . and come to rest at right angles to its original position . if the direction of the current is from south to north . the north pole of the needle will come to rest pointing west . now . hold the compass above the wire . the needle will get deflected in the opposite direction . the direction of deflection will also change if you reverse the direction of the current in the wire by interchanging the battery connections . if you switch off the current in the wire . the needle will go back to its original position . make sure that you pass a current through the wire only for short periods of time say . seconds . allowing current to pass through the wire for long will heat the wire considerably and also drain the battery rapidly .
india s installed capacity of wind energy is about mw .
the diffuse reflection of light from a rough surface can be explained as follows the particles of a rough surface like that of paper are all facing in different directions . due to this . the angles of incidence for all the parallel rays of light falling on a rough surface are different and hence the angles of reflection for all the rays of light are also different . since the angles of incidence and the angles of reflection are different . the parallel rays of light falling on a rough surface go in different directions see figure . please note that the diffuse reflection of light is not due to the failure of the laws of reflection . diffuse reflection is caused by the roughness or irregularities in the reflecting surface of an object like paper or cardboard . etc . . the laws of reflection are valid at each point even on the rough surface of an object .
 ii near point the nearest point upto which a long sighted eye can see clearly is called the near point of the eye . for a normal human eye of an adult . the near point is about cm from the eye .
it should also be noted that the whole purpose of using a concave lens here is to reduce the converging power of the eye lens . the concave lens used here decreases the converging power of the eye lens and helps in forming the image of distant object on the retina of the myopic eye .
working when sun rays fall on reflector r . they get reflected and enter the solar cooker through the glass sheet g . the rays get observed by the black surface of the box . the glass sheet does not allow the sun rays to escape out of the box . hence . more and more infrared rays from the sun get trapped inside the box and the temperature increases to about c to c which is enough for normal cooking . the black surfaces inside the cooker as well as black coloured utensils are good absorbers of heat and . therefore . absorb heat readily .

current is measured by an instrument called ammeter see figure . the ammeter is always connected in series with the circuit in which the current is to be measured . for example . if we want to find out the current flowing through a conductor bc such as a resistance wire . then we should connect the ammeter a in series with the conductor bc as shown in figure . since the entire current passes through the ammeter . therefore . an ammeter should have very low resistance so that it may not change the value of the current flowing in the circuit . let us solve one problem now .
resistance depends on area of cross section repeat the above experiment with wires of the same material and the same length . but of different cross sectional areas . you will find that the thicker the wire . the greater the current . so . the thicker wires have lesser resistance than the thinner wires . in fact . resistance is inversely proportional to the area of cross section a .

we will now describe the formation of image in a plane mirror . before we do that please remember that an object gives out a large number of light rays in all the directions but we will use only two light rays coming from the object to show the formation of image . this is done just to keep the ray diagram simple . another point to be noted is that the real rays of light are represented by full lines solid lines whereas virtual rays of light are represented by dotted lines broken lines . the real rays of light can exist only in front of a mirror . the virtual rays of light are those which we show behind a mirror . the virtual light rays do not exist at all because light cannot reach behind the mirror by passing through it . they just appear to be coming from behind the mirror . we will now describe how the image of an object is formed in a plane mirror by using the laws of reflection of light .
light control between the cornea and the lens lies a muscular diaphragm called the iris . the round . coloured part that we see in the eye is the iris . it has a small opening called the pupil . through which light enters the eye . the iris controls the diameter of the pupil automatically . in dim light . the iris widens or dilates the pupil to admit more light into the eye . in bright light . it contracts the pupil so that less light goes in . in this way . the iris pupil combination controls the amount of light into the eye to ensure that the best possible image is formed under different light conditions .
from his experiment . faraday arrived at the following conclusions a a current flows through a coil as long as a magnet moves near the coil . the coil moves near the magnet or both of them move . so . a current flows in the coil when there is relative motion between the magnet and the coil . b while there is relative motion between the magnet and the coil . the magnetic field around the coil keeps changing . the changing magnetic field causes a current in the coil . c the direction of the current depends on the direction of the magnetic field . that is why it changes when the pole facing the coil is changed . d the direction of the current depends on whether the magnetic field around the coil is increasing or decreasing . the magnetic field around the coil increases as the coil and magnet come closer and decreases as they move apart . that is why the current flows in one direction on moving the magnet towards the coil and in the opposite direction on moving the magnet away from the coil . a current produced by a changing magnetic field or magnetic flux is called an induced current . this phenomenon is called electromagnetic induction .
time t second in the above formula . then current i becomes ampere . this gives us the following definition of ampere when coulomb of charge flows through any cross section of a conductor in second . the electric current flowing through it is said to be ampere . that is . my studygear ampere coulomb do second or a sometimes . however . a smaller unit of current called milliampere is also used . which is denoted by ma . milliampere ampere or ma a or ma a thus . the small quantities of current are expressed in the unit of milliampere . ma ma a . the very small quantities of current are expressed in a still smaller unit of current called microampere . ua ua a .
the works of scientists like hans christian oersted . michael faraday and andrÃ© ampÃ¨re showed that there is a definite relationship between electricity and magnetism . before getting into how electricity and magnetism are related . let us briefly take a look at magnetism . magnetism magnetism has been a source of curiosity for ages . magnets are commonly found in science laboratories . toys and in the magnetic stickers that we stick to refrigerators and steel almirahs . the earth itself acts as a magnet . actually . magnets are all around us . since each electron . proton and neutron behaves as a tiny magnet . magnetism has many uses from the simple magnetic sticker to magnetic resonance imaging mri . mri is a diagnostic technique in which the magnetism of the protons inside the human body is used to form images of tissues .
when a bar magnet is moved quickly into a fixed coil of wire ab . then a current is produced in the coil . this current causes a deflection in the galvanometer pointer see figure a . similarly . when the magnet is moved out quickly from inside the coil . even then a current is produced in the coil see figure b . this current also causes a deflection in the galvanometer pointer but in the opposite direction showing

prism splitting the sunlight into a spectrum . this will become more clear from the following discussion . the raindrops in the atmosphere act like many small prisms . as white sunlight enters and leaves these raindrops or water drops . the various coloured rays present in white light are refracted by different amounts due to which an arch of seven colours called rainbow is formed in the sky . the formation of rainbow can be explained with the help of a diagram shown in figure . a ray of white sunlight ab enters the raindrop at point b and undergoes refraction and dispersion to form a spectrum . this spectrum undergoes total internal reflection at point c within the raindrop and finally refracted out of the raindrop at point d see figure .
refraction of light when it passes from water into air . let us understand it more clearly with the help of a ray diagram . figure shows a straight stick ao whose lower portion bo is immersed in water . though the stick is actually straight but on immersing in water . it appears to be bent at point b . in the direction bi see figure . this can be explained as follows a ray of light oc coming from the lower end o of the stick passes from water into air at point c and gets refracted away from normal in the direction cx because it passes from a denser medium water into a rarer medium air . another ray of light od gets refracted in the direction dy . the two refracted rays cx and dy . when produced backwards . appear to meet at point i . nearer to the water surface than point o see figure . thus . i is the virtual image of the end o of the stick which is formed by the refraction of light on
the fossil fuels have been used at such a fast pace in the past that only limited reserves of these fuels are now left in the earth . even today . we are mainly dependent on the fossil fuels for our energy needs . if we continue to consume fossil fuels at such a rapid rate . they will soon get exhausted . and since fossil fuels . which we are using today . were formed very . very slowly over the past millions of years . so once exhausted they will not be available to us in the near future . this will create an energy crisis . in order to avoid running out of fossil fuels and face an energy crisis . we should explore alternative sources of energy which do not depend on the fuels dug out from the earth . this will help us conserve fossil fuels for a much longer time to come . thus . we are looking at the alternative sources of energy because of the following reasons i the fossil fuel reserves in the earth are limited which may get exhausted soon if continued to be used at the current rate . ii the use of alternative sources of energy will reduce pressure on fossil fuels making them last for a much longer time . and iii by using alternative sources of energy . the pollution being caused by the burning of fossil fuels can be avoided . before we go further and study the alternative sources of energy . please answer the following questions

refractive index and speed of light the material or substance through which light travels is called medium . light is refracted or bent in going from one medium to another because its speed changes it slows down or speeds up . due to this . the refractive index n can also be written as a ratio of speeds of light in the two media .

all rays parallel to the principal axis after refraction pass through the principal focus or seem to come from it .
principal focus and focal length of a concave mirror the principal focus of a concave mirror is a point on its principal axis to which all the light rays which are parallel and close to the axis . converge after reflection from the concave mirror . look at figure in which a parallel beam of light rays is falling on a concave mirror mm . in figure . point f is the principal focus of the concave mirror because all the parallel rays of light converge at this point after getting reflected from the concave mirror . since all the reflected light rays actually pass through the focus f of a concave mirror . therefore . a concave mirror has a real focus . the focus of a concave mirror is in front of the mirror . since a concave mirror converges a parallel beam of light rays . it is also called a converging mirror . the focal length of a concave mirror is the distance between its pole and principal focus . in figure . p is the pole of the concave mirror and f is the principal focus . so the distance pf is the focal

 a real image a real image is one in which light rays actually intersect . or pass through . the image point . a real image can be obtained on a screen . when we watch a movie in a cinema hall . the images formed on the screen are real images . these images are formed by a convex lens which is used in a movie projector . the rays of light forming a real image are shown as bold lines in a ray diagram . a real image is always inverted and is formed in front of the mirror . b virtual image a virtual image is one in which the light rays do not really pass through the image point but appear to diverge from that point . a virtual image cannot be obtained on a
those substances through which electric charges can flow . are called conductors . but the flow of electric charges is called electricity . so we can also say that those substances through which electricity can flow are called conductors . all the metals like silver . copper and aluminium . etc . . are conductors see figure . the metal alloys such as nichrome . manganin and constantan which are used for making heating elements of electrical appliances are also conductors but their electrical conductivity is much less than that of pure metals . carbon . in the form of graphite . is also a conductor . the human body is a fairly good conductor .
 . nature of light before the beginning of the th century . light was considered to be a stream of particles that were emitted by a light source and stimulated the sense of sight upon entering the eye . the chief architect of this theory was isaac newton . with this theory . newton was able to provide a simple explanation of some known experimental facts concerning the nature of light . namely the laws of reflection and refraction . most scientists accepted newton s particle theory of light . this theory was called the corpuscular theory . another theory of light which treated light as a wave was put forward in . by a dutch physicist and astronomer . christian huygens .

solar energy devices the sun is one of the major sources of renewable energy . solar energy consists of heat and light . scientists have made a number of devices which help in utilising the solar energy directly in our everyday life . the devices which work by using solar energy or sun s energy are solar cooker . solar water heater . and solar cell .
the construction of lenses of the optical instruments like cameras . microscopes and telescopes . etc . . depends on an accurate knowledge of the refractive index of glass used for making lenses . please note that if any two media are optically exactly the same . then no bending occurs when light passes from one medium to another . in other words . if the refractive indices of two media are equal . then there will be no bending of light rays when they pass from one medium to another . the ability of a substance to refract light is also expressed in terms of its optical density . the optical density of a substance or medium is the degree to which it retards or slows down the rays of light passing through it . a substance having higher refractive index is optically denser than another substance having lower refractive index . for example . the refractive index of one type of glass is . and that of water is . . since glass has a higher refractive index than water .
spherical mirror terms pole the central point on the surface of the mirror is called its pole . centre of curvature and radius of curvature the centre of the sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part is called the centre of curvature of the mirror . the radius of this sphere is called the radius of curvature of the mirror . it is clear from the parts a and b of figure . that the centre of curvature lies in front of the mirror in the case of a concave mirror and it lies behind the mirror in the case of a convex mirror . a line joining the centre of curvature to a point on the mirror is . from geometry . normal to the curved surface at that point . principal axis the line joining the pole and the centre of curvature is called the principal axis of the mirror .
magnetic field lines possess the following properties . magnetic field is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude . the direction of the magnetic field is taken to be the direction in which a north pole of the compass needle moves inside it . therefore . magnetic field lines travel from the north to the south pole of a magnet outside the magnet and from south to the north pole inside the magnet . . they are continuous closed curves . . they emerge out normally from the magnetised surfaces . . the tangent drawn at any point of the magnetic lines of force represents the direction of the magnetic field at that point . . no two field lines are found to cross each other . if they did . it would mean that at the point of intersection . the compass needle would point towards two directions . which is not possible . . the field lines of a uniform magnetic field are parallel to each other . . the more crowded the magnetic field lines . the stronger is the magnetic field .
the heating elements or heating coils of electrical heating appliances such as electric iron and toaster . etc . . are made of an alloy rather than a pure metal because i the resistivity of an alloy is much higher than that of pure metal . and ii an alloy does not undergo oxidation or burn easily even at high temperature . when it is red hot . for example . nichrome alloy is used for making the heating elements of electrical appliances such as electric iron . toaster . electric kettle . room heaters . water heaters geysers . and hair dryers . etc . . because i nichrome has very high resistivity due to which the

in order to cook food . the solar cooker is kept in sunshine . outside the house . the reflector of solar cooker is adjusted in such a way that it faces the sun . when the sun s rays fall on the reflector . the reflector sends them to the top of solar cooker box in the form of a strong beam of sunlight . the sun s heat rays pass through the glass sheet cover and get absorbed by the black inside surface of the cooker box . once the sun s heat rays enter the cooker box . then the glass sheet cover does not allow them to go back . in this way . more and more heat rays of the sun get trapped in the box due to which the temperature in the solar cooker box rises to about c to c in two to three hours . this heat cooks the food materials kept in the black containers . for example . the food materials like rice . pulses dal and vegetables can be cooked in a box type solar cooker .

working fresh tap water enters the storage tank through the pipe p and then flows into the box through the copper tube q . the water gets heated in the box when flowing through the copper tube and hot water leaves the box through copper tube r . hot water from the tank is collected through the pipes . hot water is collected from the top of the storage tank as hot water is lighter and remains in the upper part of the storage tank .
high dams constructed to generate hydroelectric power give rise to a number of environmental problems the dams also affect the flora and fauna of the region where they are built .
wood wood has been a major source of energy since man discovered fire . it is still used widely as a fuel for cooking and heating . in many indian homes . food is cooked on stoves that use biomass fuels such as wood . such a stove is called a chulha . a traditional chulha operates at a very low efficiency . hardly of the energy contained in the wood is utilized . also . it does not burn the wood completely . which causes a lot of smoke . indian scientists have designed several smokeless chulhas . these produce much less smoke . and the fuel is more efficiently utilized . wood can be more efficiently utilized by converting it into charcoal . charcoal is prepared by burning wood in an insufficient supply of oxygen . the process of burning wood in insufficient supply of oxygen is called destructive distillation of wood . wood is a mixture of carbon compounds like cellulose a carbohydrate . which decompose on heating . most of the products formed escape . and what is left behind is mainly carbon . which is a better fuel than wood . you can prepare charcoal by heating wood shavings in a closed container that has a hole for gases to escape .
this effect of magnetic field is used in building machines for accelerating charged particle . such machines are called charge accelerators . these machines are used to study structure of matter .
suppose we have a vertical current carrying wire or conductor placed in a magnetic field . let the direction of magnetic field is from west to east as shown by arrow ab in figure b . again suppose that the direction of current in the wire is vertically downwards as shown by arrow ac . now . we want to find out the direction of force which will be exerted on this current carrying wire . we will find out this direction by using fleming s left hand rule as follows we stretch our left hand as shown in figure a so that the forefinger . the centre finger and the thumb are perpendicular to one another . since the direction of magnetic field is from west to east . so we point our forefinger from west to east direction to represent the magnetic field . now . the current is flowing vertically downwards . so we point our centre finger vertically downwards to represent the direction of current . now let us look at the direction of force acting on the wire or direction of motion of wire . so . the force acting on the current carrying wire will be in the south direction as shown by the arrow ad in figure b . and the wire will move in the south direction .

types of electric fuse a porcelain fuse it consists of two parts i porcelain casing fixed to a wooden board and ii porcelain grip which fits into the porcelain casing . there are two terminals t . t . fixed to the porcelain casing . the live wire is connected to terminals tÄ¯ and t . since there is no direct connection between tÄ¯ and t . no current can flow from t to t unless connected by a wire .
so the screen must be placed at a distance of cm in front of the concave mirror .
we can extend this reasoning to all the points which make up part bo of the stick under water . thus . due to the refraction of light . a virtual image of the part bo of the stick is formed at bi . so . what we see under water is actually the virtual image bi of the part bo of the stick under water . since the part ab of the stick which is above water and the image bi under water are not in the same straight line . the stick ao appears to be bent at point b along bi . thus . though the actual stick is abo . it appears to be abi . please note that it is not the stick that is really bent . it is actually the light passing from water to air that is bent or refracted see figure .
rules for drawing images formed by spherical mirrors the position of the image formed by spherical mirrors can be found by considering any two of the following rays of light coming from a point on the object .
the fact that when a parallel beam of light rays falls on a concave mirror . the concave mirror concentrates all the light at its focus . explains the use of concave mirror as a doctor s head mirror . a concave mirror is used as a head mirror by the doctors to concentrate light coming from a lamp on to the body part of a patient like ear . nose . throat . etc . to be examined . this is done as follows a concave mirror is fixed to the front part of a doctor s head with the help of a strap as shown in figure a . when the beam of light coming from a lamp falls on the doctor s concave head mirror . the mirror focusses this light on to the body part of the patient . the body part gets illuminated brightly with this light due to which the doctor can look into the body part like ear . nose . throat . etc . very clearly .
 . focal plane when rays of light parallel to the principal axis are allowed to pass through a lens they converge or seem to come from the focus . if a parallel beam of light . not parallel to the principal axis . is incident on a lens then they do not meet or seem to come from a point on the principal axis . but instead they meet in a plane perpendicular to the principal axis . this plane is called the focal plane of the lens .
we conclude that when an object is placed beyond f in front of a convex lens . then the image formed is i between f and f on the other side of the lens . ii real and inverted . and

hypermetropia long sightedness or far sightedness is corrected by using spectacles containing convex lenses . when a convex lens converging lens l of suitable power is placed in front of the hypermetropic eye as shown in figure c . then the diverging rays of light coming from the nearby object at cm are first converged by this convex lens . due to this . the convex lens forms a virtual image of the nearby object which is lying at the normal near point n at the near point n of the hypermetropic eye see figure c . since the rays of light now appear to be coming from this eye s near point n . they can be easily focused by the eye lens to form an image on the retina see figure c . please note that the convex lens used for correcting hypermetropia or long sightedness should be of such a focal length or power that it forms a virtual image of the object placed at the normal near point n of cm . at the near point n of the hypermetropic eye . m studygear
case ii when the refractive index of the medium is equal to that of the lens i . e . . um u f oo and p therefore . the focal length of the lens becomes infinity and the power becomes zero . consequently . the lens behaves like a glass slab plate . case iii when the refractive index of the medium is greater that of the lens . i . e . . um u f fo . therefore . the focal length of the lens decreases . consequently . the power of the lens increases . numerically . since um u u um is negative f is negative . the negative focal length indicates that the nature of the lens changes from converging to diverging and vice versa . fo
for example . a bulb rated v . w consumes joule of electrical energy per second when a potential difference of is applied across it . thus . the value of the voltage and power of an electrical appliance together is called its power rating .
from the above discussion we conclude that the colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering particles in the atmosphere a the larger particles of dust and water droplets present in the atmosphere scatter the light as such due to which the scattered light also appears white . b the extremely minute particles such as the air molecules present in the atmosphere scatter mainly the blue light present in the white sunlight .
 . magnetic field pattern due to straight current carrying conductor straight current carrying wire the magnetic field lines around a straight conductor straight wire carrying current are concentric circles whose centres lie on the wire figure current . in figure . we have a straight vertical wire or conductor ab which upwards passes through a horizontal cardboard sheet c . the ends of the wire ab are connected to a battery through a switch . when current is passed through wire ab . it produces a magnetic field around it . this magnetic field has magnetic field lines around the wire ab which can be shown by sprinkling iron filings on the cardboard c . the iron filings get magnetised . and on tapping the cardboard sheet . the iron filings arrange themselves in circles magnetic around the wire showing that the magnetic field lines are circular in nature . a small plotting compass m placed on the cardboard indicates the direction anticlockwise of the magnetic field . when current in the wire flows in the upward direction as shown in figure . then the lines of magnetic field are in the figure . magnetic field anticlockwise direction . if the direction of current in the wire is reversed . the pattern due to a straight current carrying wire . direction of magnetic field lines also gets reversed . it has been shown by experiments that the magnitude of magnetic field produced by a straight current carrying wire at a given point is i directly proportional to the current passing in the wire . and ii inversely proportional to the distance of that point from the wire . so . greater the current in the wire . stronger will be the magnetic field produced . and greater the distance of a point from the current carrying wire . weaker will be the magnetic field produced at that point . in fact . as we move away from a current carrying straight wire . the concentric circles around it representing magnetic field lines . become larger and larger indicating the decreasing strength of the magnetic field . field lines
in the simplest case . the current i is directly proportional to the voltage v that is . i o v . thus . a v battery leads to twice as much current as a v battery . when each is connected to the same circuit . in electrical circuits . the resistance r is defined as the ratio of the voltage v applied across a piece of material to the current i through the material . or r v i .

r o . . . i now . you know why we use thick wires for connecting different elements of a circuit . it ensures that their resistance is negligible . resistance depends on length take wires of the same material and the same thickness . but of different lengths . if the length of the first wire is . say . i . the other wires should be of length . . and so on . find the resistance v i of the first wire and then compare it with that of the others . you will find that when the length is doubled . the current is halved . in other words . the resistance is doubled . and . when the length becomes three times . the resistance also increases three times . thus . resistance is proportional to length . rocl . . . . ii resistance depends on temperature apart from these . resistance depends slightly on temperature . in general . resistance increases with increase in temperature .
the bending of light follows the following rules i in going from a rarer to a denser medium a ray of light passing obliquely from an optically rarer medium to an optically denser medium . bends towards the normal . in this case the angle of refraction is always less than the angle of incidence .
 i opposite charges or unlike charges attract each other . for example . a positive charge attracts a negative charge . ii similar charges or like charges repel each other . for example . a positive charge repels a positive charge and a negative charge repels a negative charge .

in physics . image is an optical appearance produced when light rays coming from an object are reflected from a mirror or refracted through a lens . this will become clear from the following example . when we look into a mirror . we see our face . what we see in the mirror is actually a reflection of our face and it is called image of our face . thus . when we look into a mirror . we see the image of our face in it . in this case . our face is the object and what we see in the mirror is the image . the image of our face appears to be situated behind the mirror . while watching a movie in the cinema hall . we see the images of actors and actresses on the cinema screen . please note that an image is formed when the light rays coming from an object meet or appear to meet at a point . after reflection from a mirror or refraction through a lens . the images are of two types real images and virtual images . these are discussed below .

good sources of energy what is a good source of energy that depends on many things such as the purpose for which it is needed . available resources . etc . what is good for a village might not be suitable for a factory . for choosing a source of energy for a particular purpose . we evaluate the following characteristics . energy output per unit volume the energy output per unit volume or mass of a good source of energy should be high . the gas in a kg lpg cylinder can be used by a family of average size to cook food for about a month . to cook the same amount of food using wood . you would need a roomful of wood . clearly . the energy output per unit volume of lpg . which takes a small space in the kitchen . is much higher than that of wood . steady availability the energy source should be available readily and for a long time . for example . coal and petroleum have been readily available for a long time . although the sun is a good source of energy . it is available only during the day . similarly . wind energy is reliable only in those places where there is always a wind . safe and easy to use for widespread use . the source of energy has to be safe and easy to use . a fuel that produces a lot of smoke is not a good source of energy . since it is not safe for people s health . a nuclear power plant is not easy to build and operate . this limits the use of nuclear fuels like uranium . easy to store and transport most common sources of energy such as coal . petrol and lpg need to be transported to users from their points of production . they also need to be stored before use . we should be able to transport and store such sources of energy safely and economically . economical the source of energy has to be economical . hydrogen is an excellent fuel . but . it is not widely used as it is costly to produce . store and transport it .

consider a rectangular glass slab pqrs shown in figure . now . here we have two different media . one is air and the other is glass media is the plural of medium . please note that glass is optically denser medium as compared to air we will give the meaning of optically denser medium after a while . now . a ray of light ao travelling in air is incident or falls obliquely on the glass slab at point o see figure . since the glass slab is transparent . most of the incident light passes into the glass slab . since glass is an optically denser medium than air . so when the ray of light ao passes from air into glass . its direction changes . it goes along the line ob inside the glass slab and we say that the light ray has been refracted or bent . this is because ao and ob are not in the same straight line . please note that the refraction or bending of light takes place at the boundary between the two media . for example . in figure . the refraction of light or bending of light takes place at point o at the boundary of the two media air and glass . we will now define the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction .
working coal or oil is burnt in a furnace to produce heat energy . this heat energy is used to boil water in a reservoir . the steam produced in the water reservoir is allowed to fall on a turbine under high pressure . the steam falling on the turbine through an axle rotates the turbine with high speed and produces electricity . in fact . the mechanical energy kinetic energy of rotation of the turbine is converted into electrical energy . the electricity . so produced is transmitted to distant places through transmission wires . thermal power plants are usually set up near coal fields or oil fields . so that there will be no problem in transporting the fuel .
ohm s law the current flowing through a given conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across its ends provided its temperature and the other physical conditions of the conductor remains the same . this is known as ohm s law .

 c moderator the reaction is started up by a neutron emitting source . the reactor core also contains a moderator . which acts to slow down the speed of neutrons so that they can be captured more readily by the fuel and the fission process can take place more efficiently . heavy water do and graphite act as good moderators . the moderator is arranged so that it surrounds the fuel rod to give more efficient action .
defects of vision near sightedness is a defect of vision due to which a person is not able to see distant objects clearly . it is also called short sightedness or myopia .

based on renewable sources are being tried by many countries including india . these are solar . wind . sea . geothermal and biomass . of all these . solar energy can be a major source of power . its potential is about billion mw which is about . times the world s demand .
using energy judiciously the total coal reserves in our country are estimated to be about billion tonnes . but we are consuming it at a rate of million tonnes per year . at this rate the resource that nature produced over millions of years will be consumed in just a few hundred years the situation is more alarming in the case of oil petroleum reserves . the known oil reserves of our country are about million tonnes only . of which we are consuming million tonnes per year . so . the oil reserves will last for a few decades only . the demand for energy is increasing every day . the increasing demand cannot be met for a long time unless new resources are harnessed . since conventional . nonrenewable energy sources are depleting very fast . this situation is called energy crisis . increased use of fossil fuels is also causing environmental problems such as air pollution which leads to health problems . acid rain and global warming . to overcome the energy crisis and to save the environment . we have to use energy judiciously . this means using less of nonrenewable and more of renewable energy sources . not wasting energy and saving energy wherever possible .

hydrogen bomb fusion bomb principle it works on principle of nuclear fusion which is an uncontrolled nuclear reaction . construction it consists of an arrangement for nuclear fission at the centre of a mixture of deuterium h and lithium liÂº . working the nuclear fission provides heat and neutrons . fission in the centre heat neutrons neutrons are used in converting lithium into tritium h and heat is liberated . ont l h heat energy tritium heat liberated starts fusion between h and hÂº and liberates large amount of energy h h he on energy deuterium hÂº hÂº he on energy hÂ² h he energy tritium has to be produced within the hydrogen bomb because it is not stable . enormousity of the energy produced in formation of a single helium nucleus four nucleons h take part and . mev of energy is produced . neutron . puu hence . energy released per nucleon . mev it is about times more than in fission . this fact makes hydrogen bomb times more dangerous than atom bomb which is a fission bomb .
heating effect of when an electric current is passed through a high resistance wire . like nichrome wire . the resistance wire becomes very hot and produces heat . this is called the heating effect of current . the heating effect of current is obtained by the transformation of electrical energy into heat energy . just as mechanical energy used to overcome friction is converted into heat . in the same way . electrical energy is converted into heat energy when an electric current flows through a resistance wire . thus . the role of resistance in electrical circuits is similar to the role of friction in mechanics . we will now derive a formula for calculating the heat produced when an electric current flows through a resistance wire . since a conductor . say a resistance wire . offers resistance to the flow of current . so work must be done by the current int continuously to keep itself flowing . we will calculate the work

how fossil fuels were formed the plants and animals which died millions of years ago . were gradually buried deep in the earth and got covered with sediments like mud and sand . away from the reach of oxygen of air . in the absence of oxygen . the chemical effects of pressure . heat and bacteria . converted the buried remains of plants and animals into fossil fuels like coal . petroleum and natural gas . it should be noted that the buried remains of large plants were converted into coal whereas those of small plants and animals were converted into petroleum and natural gas .
solar cells a device which converts solar energy directly into electricity is called a solar cell . solar cells are made from semiconductors like silicon . in a solar panel . a large number of solar cells are connected to get a large potential difference and current . uses in calculators . watches . artificial satellites . and in providing electricity in remote areas to run such things as pumps . telephones . lights . etc . advantages suitable for remote areas with no electricity . requires little maintenance . low operating cost . pollution free operation limitations expensive . provides only dc . requires large area for generating even modest amount of power . works only in daytime . reduced efficiency in winters and on cloudy days
natural gas is formed under the earth due to decomposition of plants and animals by anaerobic bacteria under suitable condition of temperature and pressure . natural gas was formed by a process similar to that by which petroleum was formed . natural gas was formed from the remains of marine organisms plants and animals as well as the remains of land plants that got buried under water . in the absence of oxygen underwater . they were decomposed by anaerobic bacteria . methane was formed in the process . when the organic material got buried under layers of sediments . heat and pressure produced more methane as well as oil . this gas moved up through the pores in the rocks and got trapped in pockets of nonporous rock . at some places . however . natural gas manages to find its way to the surface . natural gas consists of methane . ethane and propane . however . the main component of natural gas is methane . gas fields have been found in tripura . jaisalmer . offshore area of bombay and in krishna godavari delta .

images formed by a thin lens a convex lens can form real as well as virtual image . if the image is real . it is inverted . if the image is virtual . it is erect . the size of the image is smaller for objects beyond f . equal in size for objects at f . and larger in size for objects between f and the lens . a concave lens always forms a virtual . erect and smaller image .
in power stations . huge a . c . generators or alternators are used to generate current for dho the a . c . mains which is supplied to homes . transport and industry . the power house a . c . generators have a fixed set of coils arranged around a rotating electromagnet see figure . thus . in large power house generators . the coils are stationary and the electromagnet rotates . the big coils of a power house generator are kept stationary because they are very heavy and hence difficult to rotate . the electromagnet can . however . be rotated more easily . the shaft of electromagnet of a generator is connected to a turbine . when the turbine is turned by fast flowing water or pressure of steam . then the electromagnet turns inside the coils and generator produces electricity . 
energy meter or kwh meter after the company fuse . the cable is connected to the energy meter which records the electricity consumption of the house in kilowatt hour kwh . the earth wire from the meter is locally earthed in the compound of the house .
 . tidal energy the rise of sea water due to gravitational pull of the moon is called high tide whereas the fall of sea water is called low tide . the tidal waves in the sea build up and recede rise and fall twice a day . the enormous movement of water between the high tides and low tides provides a very large source of energy in the coastal areas of the world . the tidal energy can be harnessed by constructing a tidal barrage or tidal dam across a narrow opening to the sea see figure .
fossil fuels the combustible substances formed from the dead remains of the animals and plants which were buried deep under the surface of the earth for over millions of years are called fossil energy sources or fossil fuels . at present . a major part of our energy requirement is being supplied by fossil fuels . example of fossil fuels coal . petroleum and natural gas .
force on a current carrying wire by a magnetic field when a current carrying wire is placed in a magnetic field . a force acts on the wire . the direction of the force depends on the direction of the magnetic field as well as the direction of the current . the direction of the force is given by fleming s left hand rule if the forefinger . second finger and thumb of the left hand are stretched at right angles to each other . with the forefinger in the direction of the field and the second finger in the direction of the current then the thumb indicates the direction of the force .
 i the magnetic field lines near the coil are nearly circular and concentric . this is due to the reason that the segments of the coil in contact with the board at the points a and b are almost like straight conductors . the direction of the field lines can also be found by applying right hand thumb rule .
 . we now move the wire ab downwards rapidly between the poles of the horseshoe magnet see figure b . when the wire is moved down . the galvanometer pointer again shows a deflection . but in the opposite direction to the left side see figure . this means that when the wire is moved down in the magnetic field . even then an electric current is produced in it . but when the direction of movement of wire is reversed from up to down . then the direction of current produced in the wire is also reversed .
 b the solar cells in a solar panel are connected using silver . to keep the resistance as low as possible . this also increases the cost . c solar cells provide direct current dc . while most household appliances work on ac . special devices inverters are needed to convert the dc to ac . d since the power output of solar cells is low . a large number of solar panels . spread over a large area . are required . even to meet the normal electrical power requirement of a household . e like all solar devices . solar cells work only during the day . and their effectiveness is reduced in winters and on cloudy days . for the power requirement at night . storage batteries are charged by solar cells during the day . the batteries further add to the cost .
please note that whatever be the position of object in front of a convex mirror . the image formed by a convex mirror is always behind the mirror . it is virtual . erect and smaller than the object or diminished . when the distance of the object is changed from convex mirror . then only the position and size of the image changes . there are two main positions of an object in the case of a convex mirror from the point of view of position and size of image . the object can be i anywhere between pole p and infinity . and ii at infinity . we will discuss both these cases one by one . let us first describe the formation of image by a convex mirror when the object is placed between pole p of the mirror and infinity .
if we move the object more and more away from the pole of the convex mirror . the image becomes smaller and smaller in size and moves away from the mirror towards its focus but it remains virtual and erect for all the positions of the object . and when the object is at infinity . the image is formed at the focus . this is discussed below .
 . second law of reflection . according to the second law of reflection of light the angle of reflection is always equal to the angle of incidence . we can also state the second law of reflection of light as follows by writing the angle of incidence first the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection . if the angle of incidence is i and the angle of reflection is r . then according to the second law of reflection zi zr for example . if we measure the angle of reflection nob in figure . we will find that it is exactly equal to the angle of incidence aon . the second law of reflection of light means that if the angle of incidence is Âº . then the angle of
classification of sources of energy we can classify energy sources in different ways . one classification is based on the reserves supply of an energy source . another is based on how long we have been using it .

hence . in order to make use of solar energy we have to first collect and concentrate it . we have now developed technology that enables us to harness solar energy in a more efficient and convenient manner . the devices commonly used for harnessing solar energy are solar cookers . solar water heaters . solar water pumps and photovoltaic cells or solar cells . these devices are called solar energy devices .
do you know the earth s magnetic field is not due to a huge bar magnet inside it . the earth s core is hot and molten . perhaps convective currents in this core are responsible for the earth s magnetic field .
physics experiments over the past hundred years or so have demonstrated that light has a dual nature double nature light exhibits the properties of both waves and particles depending on the situation it is in . the modern theory of light called quantum theory of light combines both the wave and particle models of light .
alternating current suppose you connect a bulb to an ac source such as the ac supply of your house figure . a . the potential difference va vb across the bulb keeps changing with time . when the current
 . the magnetic field lines come closer to one another near the poles of a magnet but they are widely separated at other places . a north magnetic pole experiences a stronger force when it approaches one of the poles of the magnet . this means that the magnetic field is stronger near the poles . from this we conclude that where magnetic field lines are closer together . it indicates a stronger magnetic field . on the other hand . when magnetic field lines are widely separated . then it indicates a weak magnetic field .
case e needs special attention . the object ab is placed at the focus . the point a is on the focus . the ray bd is parallel to the principal axis . it passes through the point a after reflection . the ray be passes through c and retraces its path . the reflected rays da and eb turn out to be parallel . we can say that they intersect at infinity to form a real image of b below the principal axis . in this sense . the image of ab can be considered real and inverted . however . when the reflected rays fall on the eye . they appear to come from a point behind the mirror . above the principal axis . in this sense . the image may be considered virtual and erect . in case f . rays coming from b diverge after reflection . if the reflected rays are produced backwards . they meet at b . to the eye . the reflected rays appear to come from b . thus b is the image of b . and a b is the image of ab . it is a virtual image because the rays do not actually intersect . the size of the image is larger than that of the object . and the image is erect .

focal plane a vertical plane perpendicular to the principal axis . passing through the principal focus of the lens is called a focal plane . as shown in figure c and d . the plane passing through the first principal focus is called first focal plane and that passing through the second principal focus is called second focal plane .
the production of electric current by moving a magnet inside a fixed coil of wire is also a case of electromagnetic induction . the concept of a fixed coil and a rotating magnet is used to produce electricity on large scale in big generators of power houses . please note that the condition necessary for the production of electric current by electromagnetic induction is that there must be a relative motion between the coil of wire and a magnet . out of the coil of wire and a magnet . one can remain fixed but the other has to rotate or move . after performing a large number of experiments . faraday and henry made the following observations about electromagnetic induction . a current is induced in a coil when it is moved or rotated relative to a fixed magnet . . a current is also induced in a fixed coil when a magnet is moved or rotated relative to the fixed
domestic electric circuits we use different electrical appliances in our houses which work on the electricity supplied from a power distribution station . electricity generated at a power plant is distributed to consumers from distribution stations . in most places in india . the household power supply is ac . the supply is at v . hz . let us see what this means .
near sightedness can be corrected with a diverging or concave lens . as in fig . . in this case . the rays of light are first diverged by the concave lens and then converged by the eye lens . due to this combined action the image is formed on the retina . let x distance of far point of myopic eye . f focal length of concave lens to be used . as the object to be seen is at infinity and its image is to be formed at the far point . therefore . u o and v x . from lens formula vuf off xa orf x . hence . for a myopic eye . focal length of concave lens used for correcting the myopic eye is equal to distance of far point of the myopic eye .
 sign . a concave lens has a negative focal length . so the power of a concave lens is negative and written with a minus sign . since a convex lens is also known as a converging lens and a concave lens is also known as a diverging lens . we can also say that the power of a converging lens is positive whereas the power of a diverging lens is negative . when an optician . after testing the eyes of a person . prescribes the corrective lenses of say . . d and . d for the left eye and right eye . respectively . he actually refers to the power of convex lenses required for making eye glasses or spectacles to make him see clearly .
we can explain the case of no refraction or no bending of light on going perpendicularly from air to glass as follows when a beam of light consisting of light waves and travelling in air falls perpendicularly at right angles to the surface of glass slab . then all the parts of light waves reach the glass slab at the same time . enter the glass slab at the same time and hence get slowed down at the same time see figure . due to this no change in direction of light takes place . in other words . no refraction of light no bending of light takes place . similarly . all the parts of the light waves of the beam of light travelling in glass slab come out of the glass slab into air at the same time and hence speed up at the same time . due to this . no bending of light occurs when the light waves go out from glass slab into air see figure .
causes the two possible causes of this defect are decrease in length of the eye ball . as if distance of retina from the eye lens has decreased . increase in focal length of the eye lens . when the eye is fully relaxed .

 . . dispersion of light in nature a rainbow is a coloured arc seen in the sky during or after a rainfall . a rainbow is formed due to a combination of refraction . dispersion and total internal reflection . the following conditions must be satisfied for viewing a rainbow i there is a bright sunshine after a rainfall and the sky is almost clear . ii the sun is at the back of the observer .
sometimes two holes are drilled into the earth in the region of hot rocks and two pipes are put into them . cold water is pumped in through one of the pipes . this cold water is turned into steam by the hot rocks . the steam thus formed comes out through the other pipe and used to generate electricity .
working of a dc generator to generate electricity . the shaft . on which the coil is mounted . needs to be rotated . in gensets . this is done by a small diesel engine . in the case of the dynamo of a bicycle . the rotating wheel rotates the shaft . in power stations . steam . water or wind falling on the blades of a turbine rotates the generator s shaft . as the coil rotates in the magnetic field . electricity is generated . when an electrical device is connected across the terminals of the generator . the circuit is completed and a current flows through the coil . if the terminals are left open . there is no current . but a potential difference appears between them . in figure . a . the brushes b and b are in contact with the halves cÄ¯ and c of the commutator respectively . b . is connected to the terminal p . and b is connected to the terminal q . in the situation shown in figure . a . the arm ab of the coil is moving downwards . while the arm dc is moving upwards . applying fleming s left hand rule . we find that the current in the coil flows along dcba . thus . the current flows through the bulb from p to q . after half a rotation . the brushes with which the two halves of the commutator were in contact get interchanged figure . b . now . the arm ab is moving upwards and the arm dc is moving downwards . this causes the current to flow along abcd . the current through the bulb . however . remains from p to q . this means that the terminal p always remains at a higher potential than q . since a current flows from a higher to a lower potential . note that although the direction of the current in the arms of the coil changes with each half rotation . the commutator and brush arrangement ensures that the current in the external circuit remains in the same direction . as long as the coil is rotating . a direct current flows through the device connected to the terminals of the generator .
sun is the ultimate source of fossil fuels we have just seen that fossil fuels have been produced from the remains of plants and animals that were buried in the earth long ago . actually . it was the sunlight of long ago that made plants grow . which were then converted into fossil fuels . this can be explained as follows the green plants need sunlight energy to grow . they get this energy from sunlight . and store it in the form of carbon compounds . so . every leaf and every bit of wood in the plant was made with the energy of sunlight . the animals also eat plants . so the animal material is also a store house of sun s energy . these plants and animals which were originally made by using sun s energy have been converted into fossil fuels like coal . petroleum and natural gas . thus . fossil fuels are energy rich compounds of carbon which were originally made by the plants with the help of sun s energy solar energy . without sunlight . there could have been no coal . petroleum . natural gas . wood or any other fuel in this world . today when we burn coal . petroleum or natural gas . we are actually making use of the sunlight energy that was stored by the plants millions of years ago . we will now discuss the three fossil fuels . coal . petroleum and natural gas . one by one . let us start with coal .
it must be heated to a certain minimum temperature . the minimum temperature to which a fuel must be heated so that it may catch fire and start burning . is known as its ignition temperature . when we apply a burning matchstick or a lighter spark to the burner of a gas stove . we actually supply a little heat to cooking gas coming out of gas burner so that it gets heated to its ignition temperature and start burning . no fuel can burn unless it is heated to its ignition temperature .
thumb points vertically downwards to represent the direction of motion . then we will find that our centre finger points towards north figure b and this gives the direction of induced current . thus . the induced current in this case will be towards north as represented by arrow ad in figure a . please note that fleming s right hand rule is also called dynamo rule .

suppose the direction of magnetic field is directed from east to west as shown by arrow ab in figure a . and the direction of motion of conductor is vertically downwards . as shown by the arrow ac in figure a . then to find out the direction of induced current in the conductor . we hold the thumb . the forefinger and centre finger of our right hand mutually at right angles to one another . we adjust the right hand in such a way that the forefinger points from east to west to represent the magnetic field . and the

two rays useful for ray tracing to find the point of intersection of the reflected rays . you need any two rays . we choose two incident rays that get reflected along known paths . the first can be the ray that is incident parallel to the principal axis . after reflection . it passes through the focus . which is a known point . the other ray can be the one that is incident perpendicular to the mirror s surface . since its angle of incidence is zero . the angle of reflection is also zero . i . e . . the ray turns right back . or retraces its path . being perpendicular to the spherical surface . the ray or its projection backwards passes through the centre of curvature . another known point .
cattle dung cattle dung has been traditionally used as a fuel in india . the dung is shaped into flat cakes . dried and used as fuel for cooking . burning cattle dung cake produces some heat and a lot of smoke . scientists have now found a better way of using cattle dung to produce biogas . which is an excellent fuel . this gas is popularly called gobar gas .

working to generate electricity . the shaft on which the coil is mounted is rotated . fig . a shows ab arm is moving down . and cd arm is moving up and the current flows along dcba in accordance with fleming s right hand rule . fig . b shows the situation after half a rotation arm ab is moving up and arm cd is moving down . this causes the current to flow along abcd in accordance with fleming s right hand rule . thus . the direction of the current in the arms of the coil changes with each half rotation and so does the current through the circuit . in other words . alternating current flows through the circuit .
generating electricity from wind a windmill can be designed to rotate the shaft of a generator . such a windmill is usually called a wind turbine . a specially designed wind turbine is connected to the shaft of small generator . the electricity produced by such an arrangement is not sufficient even for a small town . to be commercially useful . a number of wind electric generators are set up in a large area . called a wind farm . the combined electrical outputs of all the generators are then used to supply power .

do you know sky appears greyish over cities having industrial units . the smoke and dust particles in the atmosphere over such cities scatter red . orange and yellow colours more than other colours of small wavelength . hence . the sky appears greyish .
 . optically rarer and optically denser medium the different media through which light travels have different optical densities . when two media are compared . an optically denser medium is one in which the velocity of light is less and . an optically rarer medium is one in which the velocity of light is more . the speed of light in air is x m s . . m s in water and m s in glass . thus . when air and water are compared . air is optically rarer than water . when air and glass are compared . air is optically rarer than glass . similarly . when we compare water and glass . then water is optically rarer than glass . this means light has its maximum velocity in air . then in water and least in glass .

will be real and inverted . and highly magnified or highly enlarged . from this discussion we conclude that when an object is placed at the focus of a convex lens . the image formed is i at infinity . ii real and inverted . and iii highly enlarged . suppose we have a convex lens of focal length cm . then its focus f will be at a distance of cm from it . so . by saying that the object is placed at the focus of this convex lens . we mean that the object is placed at a distance of cm from the convex lens on its left side . in this case the convex lens converts the diverging rays of light coming from the object into a parallel beam of light rays which form an image at infinity or very large distance .

candle as the object then the image of its wick will be formed on a white screen placed at the image position . if we look at the image a b . we find that it is wrong side up having arrow head at its bottom . so . we say that the image is inverted . the size of image is larger than the object . so the image is magnified . and
please note that in all our ray diagrams the object . an arrow ab figure . pointing upwards . will be placed on the principal axis . so . a ray of light coming from the bottom b of the object always travels along the principal axis and gets reflected back along the same path . we . however . do not put arrows on the principal axis to show this ray of light . we will now draw the ray diagrams to show the images formed by a concave mirror for the different positions of an object . we will consider all the six positions of the object . one by one .
 . . merits of hydroelectricity . hydro energy is a clean and renewable energy source . hydro energy is renewed naturally by rainwater and melting of snow on high mountains during summer .
it should be noted that the solenoid containing soft iron core in it acts as a magnet only as long as the current is flowing in the solenoid . if we switch off the current in the solenoid . it no more behaves as a magnet . all the magnetism of the soft iron core disappears as soon as the current in the coil is switched off . a very important point to be noted is that it is the iron piece inside the coil which becomes a strong electromagnet on passing the current . the core of an electromagnet must be of soft iron because soft iron loses all of its magnetism when current in the coil is switched off . on the other hand . if steel is used for making the core of an electromagnet . the steel does not lose all its magnetism when the current is stopped and it becomes a permanent magnet . this is why steel is not used for making electromagnets . electromagnets can be made in different shapes and sizes depending on the purpose for which they are to be used .
in volts on the dial of the voltmeter . a voltmeter has a high resistance so that it takes a negligible current from the circuit . the term volt gives rise to the word voltage . voltage is the other name for potential difference . we will now solve some problems based on potential difference .

other side of the prism . please note that when the glass prism is kept on its base as shown in figure . then the red colour is at the top and violet colour is at the bottom of the spectrum . the splitting up of white light into seven colours on passing through a transparent medium like a glass prism is called dispersion of light . the formation of spectrum of seven colours shows that white light is made up of lights of seven different colours mixed together . that is . white light is a mixture of seven colours or seven coloured lights . the effect of glass prism is only to separate the seven colours of white light . a similar band of seven colours is produced when a beam of white light from an electric bulb falls on a triangular glass prism . we can explain the dispersion of light by a glass prism as follows .
the residue left in a biogas plant is excellent manure rich in nitrates and phosphates .
the other hand . the current is inversely proportional to resistance . so . if the resistance is doubled . the current gets halved . and if the resistance is halved . the current gets doubled . thus . the strength of an electric current in a given conductor depends on two factors i potential difference across the ends of the conductor . and ii resistance of the conductor . we will now discuss the electrical resistance of a conductor in detail .

this constant is called refractive index . we will now discuss the refractive index in somewhat detail .
safety devices to prevent accidents . safety devices are used in circuits involving high voltages normally . v or more . these safety devices break the circuit whenever an abnormally high current flows through it . common safety devices include the fuse and the circuit breaker . you already know how a fuse works . the fuse wire melts when the current through it exceeds its rated value . this breaks the circuit . let us see how a circuit breaker works . a circuit breaker has a switch and a solenoid connected in series in the live line of a circuit . a heavy soft iron core lies partially in the solenoid . when a current greater than a particular value passes through the solenoid . the core gets pulled in . the core hits the switch to open it and break the circuit . the switch can be turned on again manually once the electrical fault is rectified . figure . shows how a circuit breaker works .

 . effect of the nature of material of the conductor the electrical resistance of a conductor say . a wire depends on the nature of the material of which it is made . some materials have low resistance whereas others have high resistance . for example . if we take two similar wires . having equal lengths and diameters . of copper metal and nichrome alloy . we will find that the resistance of nichrome wire is about times more than that of the copper wire . this shows that the resistance of a conductor depends on the nature of the material of the conductor .

 . resistance of different materials in a water pipe . the length and cross sectional area determines the resistance that the pipe offers to the flow of water . longer pipes with smaller cross sectional areas offer greater resistance . similar effects are found in the electrical case . for a wide range of materials . it is found that the resistance of a conductor is . directly proportional to the length of the conductor i . e . . r o l . . . . . . inversely proportional to the cross sectional area of the conductor i . e . . ra . . . . combining equations . and . . we have r o l . . . . r pl . . . . where p rho is a constant and is called the electrical resistivity or specific resistance of the material of the conductor . it is a characteristic property of the material . let l and a . then equation . gives p r .
resistivity is independent of the length and cross sectional area of the conductor . both resistance and resistivity vary with temperature . metals and alloys have very low resistivity in the range of m to m . they are good conductors of electricity . insulators like rubber and glass have resistivity of the order of to m . table . reveals that the resistivity of an alloy is generally higher than that of its constituent metals .

choice of a good fuel the fuel which we choose for our domestic or industrial use should have a high calorific value . this means that the fuel chosen should be such that it gives us more heat per unit mass . the fuel should burn without giving any smoke or harmful gases . in other words . the combustion products produced by the burning of fuel should not be poisonous . and they should not pollute the environment . carbon dioxide and water vapour are the harmless products produced by the burning of fuels . but some fuels produce poisonous gases like carbon monoxide co and sulphur dioxide so . etc . . which pollute the air around us . the fuel should have a proper ignition temperature which should be well above the normal room temperature .

hand so that your thumb points in the direction of current . then the direction in which your fingers encircle the wire will give the direction of magnetic field lines around the wire . figure shows a straight current carrying wire ab in which the current is flowing vertically upwards from a to b . to find out the direction of magnetic field lines produced by this current . we imagine the wire ab to be held in our right hand as shown in figure so that our thumb points in the direction of current towards b . now . the direction in which our fingers are folded gives the direction of magnetic field lines . in this case our fingers are folded in the anticlockwise direction . so the direction of magnetic field or magnetic field lines is also in the anticlockwise direction as shown by the circle drawn at the top of the wire . do maxwell s right hand thumb rule is also known as maxwell s corkscrew rule corkscrew is a device for pulling corks from bottles . and consists of a spiral metal rod and a handle . according to maxwell s corkscrew rule imagine driving a corkscrew in the direction of current then the direction in which we turn its handle is the direction of magnetic field or magnetic field lines . the corkscrew rule is illustrated in figure . in figure . the direction of current is vertically downwards . now . if we imagine driving the corkscrew downwards in the direction of current . then the handle of corkscrew is to be turned in the clockwise direction . so . the direction of magnetic field or magnetic field lines will also be in the clockwise direction . this example is opposite to the one we considered in right hand thumb rule given above . thus . when electric current flows vertically upwards the direction of magnetic field produced is anticlockwise . on the other hand . when electric current flows vertically downwards then the direction of magnetic field is clockwise .
in our ray diagrams . the object is always placed above the principal axis . so the height hy of the object will always be positive . we also know that a virtual image is always formed above the principal axis . therefore . the height hz of a virtual image will be positive . but a real image is formed below the principal axis . so the height h of a real image will be negative because it is measured in the downward direction . from this discussion we conclude that though the height of object hy is always positive . the height h of the image can be either positive or negative .

this is due to the fact that the magnetic field produced by a current carrying wire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it . therefore . if there is a circular coil having n turns . the field produced is n times as large as that produced by a single turn . this is because the current in each circular turn has the same direction . and the field due to each turn then just adds up .
the condition can be corrected with a converging or convex lens . as shown in fig . . in this case . the rays of light are first converged by the convex lens and then by the eye lens . due to this combined action the image is formed on the retina . in fact . the rays of light starting from the normal near point converge on passing through the convex lens . and should appear to come from n . the near point of the hypermetropic eye . this is shown in fig . .

again suppose that . on burning . fuel a produces gases like co . ho . co . so . so . etc . . whereas fuel b produces only co and ho . out of these gases carbon monoxide co . sulphur dioxide so and sulphur trioxide so are poisonous gases or harmful gases . now . since fuel a produces poisonous gases like co . so and so . on burning . therefore . fuel a is not a good fuel . on the other hand . burning of fuel b produces only harmless products like carbon dioxide co and water vapour ho . so fuel b is a better fuel . similarly . if a fuel burns with an explosion . it will not be a good fuel and if it leaves behind a lot of ash on burning . even then it cannot be a good fuel . let us solve one problem now .
do you know planets do not twinkle . because planets are very close to the earth as compared to the stars . so the intensity of light we receive from the planets is very large . therefore . the variation in the brightness of the planets is not detected .
nuclide it is a specific nucleus of an atom which is characterised by its atomic number z and mass number a . it is represented by zx where x is the chemical symbol of the element . i
the electric current is a flow of electric charges called electrons in a conductor such as a metal wire . the magnitude of electric current in a conductor is the amount of electric charge passing through a given point of the conductor in one second . if a charge of q coulombs flows through a conductor in time t seconds . then the magnitude i of the electric current flowing through it is given by current .
 . processing of nuclear fuels the fuels like u used in nuclear reactors are radioactive . hence . mining and enrichment of uranium involves a great risk of nuclear radiations to the persons involving in these processes .
hydroelectricity electricity generated by using the kinetic energy of flowing water is called hydroelectricity . the electric power thus generated is called hydroelectric power . electricity is generated from flowing water at a hydroelectric power plant . for large hydroelectric plants . water from a river is diverted to a large reservoir . which is an artificial lake to store water . a high dam is constructed on one side of the reservoir to hold back the water . the building housing the generator is at the base of the dam . on its other side . water flows down through pipes from near the top of the dam to the generator house below . it strikes the blades of a water turbine with tremendous speed . making it rotate . the turbine rotates the shaft of a generator to which it is connected . this makes the generator produce electricity . in this way . the kinetic energy of flowing water is used to rotate the turbine . and the rotational kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy . it is not necessary to set up large dams for hydroelectric plants . small hydroelectric plants can be set up to generate electricity from a few hundred kilowatts to tens of megawatts . such plants can use water diverted from a waterfall or from a dam built for irrigation . 
at noon . the sun is overhead . the rays of light from the sun enter the atmosphere normally and hence they do not bend at all while passing through the atmosphere . therefore . the sun appears circular at noon .
in figure . . zaon zbon . and the three lines ao . the same laws hold for reflection from a curved surface as well . we can determine the path of the reflected ray by drawing the normal to the curved surface at the point of incidence of light . to draw a normal at a point o on a curved surface . first draw a tangent pq to the surface at that point figure . . a normal on to this tangent is also normal to the curved surface . for a spherical surface . a radius through a point on the surface is normal to the surface .
the two insulated wires l and n . coming from the electric pole . enter a box fitted just inside our house . in this box . a main fuse f is put in the live wire . this fuse has a high rating of about amperes . the two line wires then enter the electricity meter m which records the electrical energy consumed by us in the units of kilowatt hours . the main fuse and the meter are both installed by the electric supply department of our city .
figure shows three resistances r . r and r connected in series . a battery of v volts has been applied to the ends of this series combination of resistances . now . suppose the potential difference across the resistance r is v . the potential difference across the resistance r is v and that across resistance r is v . we have applied a battery of voltage v . so the total potential difference across the three resistances should be equal to the voltage of the battery applied . that is . v v v v . . . . we have just seen that the total potential difference due to battery is v . now . let the total resistance or resultant resistance of the combination be r . the current flowing through the whole circuit is i .
on a careful study of figure . . we find that at every point of the wire the magnetic field lines are concentric circles with ever increasing radii as we move away from the wire . when we reach the centre of the circular loop . the arcs of these big circles start appearing as straight lines . it is to be noted that every point on the circular current carrying wire gives rise to the magnetic field appearing as straight lines at the centre . by applying the right hand thumb rule . we find that every section of the wire contributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction within the loop .
 the size of the moon is much smaller than stars . still it appears bigger . why ans . the apparent size of an object as seen by our eyes depends on the visual angle . the moon is much closer to the earth than the stars . hence moon subtends a greater visual angle at our yes appears bigger than the stars .
 ii cones are the cone shaped cells present in the retina of an eye which are sensitive to bright light or normal light . the cone cells of our retina also respond to colours . in other words . cone cells cause the sensation of colour of objects in our eyes . the cone shaped cells of the retina make us see colours and also make us distinguish between various colours see figure . cone cells of the retina function only in bright light . the cones do not function in dim light . this is why when it is getting dark at night . it becomes impossible to see colours of cars on the road .

magnetic effect of current or electromagnetism the magnetic effect of current was discovered by oersted in . oersted found that a wire carrying a current was able to deflect a compass needle . now . the compass needle is a tiny magnet which can be deflected only by a magnetic field . since a current carrying wire was able to deflect a compass needle . it was concluded that a current flowing in a wire always gives rise to a magnetic field around it . the importance of magnetic effect of current lies in the fact that it gives rise to mechanical forces . the electric motor . electric generator . telephone and radio . all utilize the magnetic effect of current . the magnetic effect of current is also called electromagnetism which means electricity produces magnetism .

introduction ever watchful . the lion on the title page drinks from a quiet pool . whose smooth mirror like surface acts to double his presence . mirrors produce images because the light that strikes them is reflected . rather than absorbed . reflected light does much more than produce dramatic and beautiful pictures . however . for example . it allows our sense of vision to be remarkably useful . when we see an object . light from it enters our eyes and evokes the sensation of vision . thus . we can say that light is a form of energy which . excites in us the sensation of sight .
 . the pollution of air caused by burning petroleum fuels like petrol and diesel in vehicles can be controlled by fitting the vehicles with catalytic converters see figure . the catalytic converter is a device which changes the harmful gases coming from the engine of a car into harmless gases before releasing them into air . for example . the catalytic converter brings about the complete combustion of the poisonous gas carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide which is not poisonous at all . it also changes harmful nitrogen oxides into harmless nitrogen gas . the catalytic converter is fitted in the exhaust system of a vehicle like a car .
in our everyday life . we use plane mirrors of different shapes and sizes depending on where they are being used . but in a science laboratory . a small rectangular strip of plane mirror is usually used for performing experiments on the reflection of light . in our diagrams . a plane mirror is represented by a straight line having a number of short . oblique lines on one side see figure b . the plane side of straight line is the front side of the mirror where the reflection of light takes place . and the side having short . oblique lines represents the back side of the plane mirror . in figure b . the straight line mm read as mm dash represents a plane mirror .
 d coolant a coolant liquid molten na or heavy water circulates through the reactor core to carry off the heat generated by the nuclear fission . the liquid enters the base of the reactor core and come out at the top . the heat carried by the circulating liquid coming out from top is used for producing steam . as a result the liquid cools down and is pumped back to the base of the reactor . the cooling liquid also serves as the neutrons moderator .
for removal . the floating gas holder type biogas plant is expensive and has increased cost of maintenance because it has to be painted frequently to prevent it from corrosion and leakage of the gas .
direction of electric current when electricity was invented a long time back . it was known that there are two types of charges positive charges and negative charges . but the electron had not been discovered at that time . so . electric current was considered to be a flow of positive charges and the direction of flow of the positive charges was taken to be the direction of electric current . thus . the conventional direction of electric current is from positive terminal of a cell or battery to the negative terminal . through the outer circuit . so . in our circuit diagrams . we put the arrows on the connecting wires pointing from the positive terminal of the cell towards the negative terminal of the cell . to show the direction of conventional current see figure . the

 . a pool of water appears to be less deep than it actually is if we look into a pool of water or tank of water . it appears to be less deep than it really is . this is due to the refraction of light which takes place when light rays pass from the pool of water into the air . let us understand it more clearly with the help of a ray diagram .
according to clock face rule . look at one face of a circular wire or coil through which a current is passing i if the current around the face of circular wire or coil flows in the clockwise direction . then that face of the circular wire or coil will be south pole s pole . ii if the current around the face of circular wire or coil flows in the anticlockwise direction . then that face of circular wire or coil will be a north pole n pole 
twinkling of stars light emitted by stars passes through the atmosphere of the earth before reaching our eyes . the atmosphere of the earth is not uniform but consists of many layers of different densities . the layers close to the surface of the earth are optically denser . as we go higher and higher . the density of layers and refractive index decreases progressively . as the light from a star enters the upper most layer of the atmosphere . it bends towards the normal as it enters the next layer .

in figure . the current is flowing in the vertically downward direction and the direction of magnetic field is from left to right directed towards east . thus . the current carrying conductor is at right angles to the magnetic field . now . we have just seen that the motion of the conductor is in the forward direction towards south which is at right angles to both . the direction of current and the direction of magnetic field . since the direction of motion of the wire represents the direction of force acting on it . we can say that the direction of force acting on a current carrying wire placed in a magnetic field is i perpendicular to the direction of current . and ii perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field . in other words . we can say that the
spectrum red orange yellow green blue white light indigo violet fig . . dispersion of light by a prism produces a spectrum of its component colours . the splitting is exaggerated for clarity . the band of colours obtained in this activity is continuous . with a colour changing to the next colour in a smooth . gradual way . in other words . there is no sharp boundary between one colour and the next . however . in this band of colours one can distinguish seven main . or prominent . colours . these are violet . indigo . blue . green . yellow . orange and red . in sequence . this sequence of colours can be remembered as vibgyor . which is formed by the first letters of the names of the colours . whenever white light is split . its coloured components appear in this sequence . you see these colours in a rainbow too . when white light is dispersed . violet light deviates the most and red light deviates the least . this means . the refractive index of the prism material is the largest for violet and the least for red . the band of different colours obtained when white light is split is an example of a spectrum . which can be defined as follows .

diverging rays of light coming from a nearby object o placed at the normal near point n cm from the eye are converged to form an image i behind the retina due to which the eye cannot see the nearby object clearly see figure a . the image is formed behind the retina either due to low converging power of eye lens or because of eye ball being too short .

the power of a lens is said to be one dioptre if its focal length is metre . it should be remembered that in order to find the power of a lens . its focal length should first be converted into metre . since the focal length of a convex lens is positive . therefore a converging lens or convex power has a positive power . on the other hand . the focal length of a concave lens is negative therefore . a diverging lens or concave lens has a negative power . this means when the value of power is written for a convex lens it is given a positive sign . e . g . . if the power of a convex lens is d . it is written as d . on the other hand . when the value of power is written for a concave lens it is given a negative sign . e . g . . if the power of a concave lens is d it is written as d .

tungsten metal is used for making the filaments of electric bulbs because it has a very high melting point of c . due to its very high melting point . the tungsten filament can be kept white hot without melting away . the other properties of tungsten which make it suitable for making filaments of electric bulbs are its high flexibility and low rate of evaporation at high temperature . please note that when the tungsten filament of an electric bulb becomes white hot and glows to emit light . then its temperature is about c if air is present in an electric bulb . then the extremely hot tungsten filament would burn up quickly in the oxygen of air . so . the electric
the split ring commutator ensures that the current is reversed through the coil after half revolution to yield a torque pair of forces that produces a continuous rotation of the coil . it should be remembered that the two sides ab and cd are perpendicular to the magnetic field . hence . they experience a force . whereas the sides bc and da are parallel to the magnetic field . therefore . they do not experience a force .
direction of electric current the conventional direction of flow of electric current is the direction of flow of positive charges . consider two metallic spheres a and b as shown in figure . now let us create the potential difference between them by charging the sphere a with positive charge and sphere b with equal negative charge and connect the two spheres with a metal rod . the direction of flow of electrons is determined by a quantity called the potential of the conductor . the conductor having excess of electrons is said to be at lower potential and that having deficiency of electrons is said to be at higher potential . since

when the light coming from a star enters the earth s atmosphere . it undergoes refraction due to the varying optical densities of air at various altitudes . the atmosphere is continuously changing due to which the optical densities of air at different levels in the atmosphere keep on changing . the continuously changing atmosphere refracts the light from the stars by different amounts from one moment to the next . when the atmosphere refracts more star light towards us . the star appears to be bright and when the atmosphere refracts less star light . then the star appears to be dim . in this m studygear way . the star light reaching our eyes increases and decreases continuously due to d exo atmospheric refraction . and the star appears to twinkle at night .
let us now state the sign convention for distances perpendicular to the principal axis . coordinate convention for ho . he the object height h . is always taken as positive . if the image is formed on the same side of the principal axis erect image . the image height he is also positive . if the image is formed on the opposite side inverted image . he is negative .
please note that if a ray of light is incident on a concave mirror along its principal axis . then it is reflected back along the same path because it will be normal to the mirror surface . the angle of incidence as well as the angle of reflection for such a ray of light will be zero .

when a current passes through the solenoid . a magnetic field is produced inside it . the iron bolt or any other iron object placed in this field gets magnetized . i . e . . it becomes a magnet . however . when the current is switched off . the magnetic field inside the solenoid becomes zero . and the bolt loses its magnetism . a magnet formed temporarily due to the magnetic field of a current is called an electromagnet . electromagnets have the following properties . a unlike a permanent magnet . the electromagnet s magnetism is not permanent . b the electromagnet has poles at its ends . however . the end at which a pole appears is not fixed . the poles get interchanged when the direction of current through the solenoid is changed . the iron used in nails . bolts . etc . . is a soft magnetic material . and is called soft iron . such a material becomes magnetized in a magnetic field . but loses its magnetism once the field is removed . electromagnets are made by winding wire over a core such as a rod made of a soft magnetic material . this is to ensure that the electromagnet loses its magnetism once the current is switched off . if you put a rod made of a hard magnetic material such as carbon steel in a magnetic field for some time . the rod will become a permanent magnet . strong permanent magnets are actually made this way .

the solar energy which reaches the earth is absorbed by land and water bodies like rivers . lakes and oceans . and plants . the solar energy trapped by land and water bodies causes many phenomena in nature like winds . storms . rain . snowfall . and sea waves . etc . and the plants utilise solar energy to prepare food by the process of photosynthesis . india is fortunate to receive solar energy for greater part of the year . it has been estimated that india receives solar energy equivalent to more than trillion kwh x kwh during a year . under clear cloudless sky conditions . the daily average of solar energy varies from to kwh m in our country .
when the eye is looking at a distant object at infinity . then the ciliary muscles of the eye are fully relaxed . the relaxed ciliary muscles of the eye pull the suspensory ligaments attached to the eye lens tightly . the suspensory ligaments . in turn . pull the eye lens due to which the eye lens gets stretched and becomes thin or less convex see figure a . the thin eye lens has large focal length but its converging power is small . the small converging power of thin eye lens is sufficient to converge the parallel rays of light coming from a distant object to form an image on the retina of the eye see figure a . when the eye is looking at a distant object . the eye is said to be unaccommodated because it is the relaxed state of the eye .

switch on the source of light s . we will find that a beam of light passes through water in the glass tank and forms a circular patch of white light on the screen r . we can . however . not see the path of the beam of light inside the water of the tank because there are no suspended particles in water to scatter the beam of light . let us now dissolve about grams of sodium thiosulphate called hypo in water of the glass tank . then add to ml of concentrated sulphuric acid to the water . we will see that fine microscopic particles of sulphur begin to form in water and a colloidal solution is obtained . as the sulphur particles begin to form in water . we will see the blue light coming from the sides of the glass tank see figure . this is due to the scattering of short wavelength blue light present in the beam of white light by the minute colloidal sulphur particles . this is how the sky looks blue when the blue light present in sunlight is scattered by the molecules of air in the atmosphere .

silver metal is one of the best reflectors of light . for example . a polished block of silver metal reflects almost all the light falling on it and does not transmit any light through it . but the surface of silver metal is easily scratched and soon becomes rough . so . ordinary mirrors are made by depositing a thin layer of silver metal on the back side of a plane glass sheet . the silver layer is then protected by a coat of red paint . the reflection of light in a plane mirror or any other mirror takes place at the silver surface in it . thus . a plane mirror is a thin . flat and smooth sheet of glass having a shining coating of silver metal on one

plane mirror is laterally inverted or sideways reversed with respect to the object . it is due to lateral inversion that the image of our right hand appears to be our left hand . so . when we sit in front of a plane mirror and write with our right hand . it appears in the mirror that we are writing with the left hand . and it is also due to lateral inversion that the parting in our hair on the right appears to be on the left when seen in a mirror . the word ambulance on the hospital vans is written in the form of its mirror image as ovajuoma see figure . this is because when we are driving our car and see the hospital van coming from behind in our rear view mirror . then we will get the laterally inverted image of jÃµnajuoma and read it as ambulance . since an ambulance carries seriously ill patients . we can make way for it to pass through and reach the hospital quickly . we are now in a position to give all the characteristics of an image formed by a plane mirror . . the image formed in a plane mirror is virtual . it cannot be received on a screen .

all available energy sources can be divided into two categories primary and secondary energy source .
the devices used to harness this energy are called ocean thermal energy conversion otec power plants . a temperature difference of about c upto a water level difference of m is required to operate these plants . in one of the otec power plants the warm surface water is used to boil ammonia . the vapours of this liquid is then used to drive turbines and hence generators . the cold sea water is pumped up again to convert ammonia into vapour . this system can be operated hours in a day . this system is depicted in figure . .
disadvantages of nuclear energy the disadvantages of nuclear energy are that i the waste products of nuclear fission reactions produced at nuclear power plants are radioactive which keep on emitting harmful nuclear radiations for thousands of years . so . it is very difficult to store or dispose of nuclear wastes safely . improper nuclear waste storage or disposal can pollute the environment . ii there is the risk of accidents in nuclear reactors especially the old nuclear reactors . such accidents lead to the leakage of radioactive materials which can cause serious damage to the plants . animals including human beings and the environment . iii the high cost of installation of nuclear power plants and the limited availability of my studygear uranium fuel make the large scale use of nuclear energy prohibitive .

effect of industrialisation all the factories and companies which are engaged in the process of manufacturing goods from raw materials . taken together . are called an industry . the process of developing industries in a country on a large scale is called industrialisation . industrialisation has led to a better quality of life of the people all over the world . but the setting up of industries and running them needs energy . so . the increasing industrialisation has caused the demand for energy to grow at a tremendous rate . at present . the growing demand for energy is largely met through the use of fossil fuels coal . petroleum and natural gas .
 . power of accommodation it is the ability of the eye to change the focal length of the eye lens so as to always obtain the image at the retina . the eye focuses on a given object by varying the shape of the pliable crystalline lens through an amazing process arus called accommodation . an important component in accommodation is the ciliary muscle . which is attached to the lens . when the eye is focused on distant objects . the ciliary muscle is relaxed . for an object distance of infinity . the focal length of the eye the distance between the lens and the retina is about . cm . the eye focuses on nearby objects by tensing the ciliary muscle . this action effectively decreases the focal length by slightly decreasing the radius of curvature of the lens . which allows the image to be focused on the retina . this lens adjustment takes place so swiftly that we are not even aware of the change . again . in this respect . even the finest electronic camera is a toy . compared with the eye . it is evident that there is a limit to accommodation because objects that are very close to the eye produce blurred images . when we try to see objects lying nearby the ciliary muscles contract to increase the curvature of the lens . the thickness of the lens increases so that its focal length decreases and the image is again formed on the retina . this process of adjustment of the focal length is called accommodation . the power of accommodation of the eye is the maximum variation of its power for focusing nearby and distant objects . for a young person . the power of accommodation is about dioptre .

all the fuels produce heat energy on burning . different fuels produce different amounts of heat on burning . some fuels produce more heat whereas others produce less heat . the usefulness of a fuel is measured in terms of its calorific value . higher the calorific value . better the fuel will be . the amount of heat produced by burning a unit mass of the fuel completely is known as its calorific value . the unit of mass usually taken for measuring the calorific value of a fuel is gram . so . we can also say that the amount of heat produced by burning gram of a fuel completely is called its calorific value . for example . when one gram of a carbon fuel like charcoal is burned completely . it produces about joules of heat . so the calorific value of charcoal is joules per gram or j g . since joule is a very small unit of heat energy . so the calorific value is usually expressed as kilojoules per gram kj g . thus . the calorific value of charcoal becomes kilojoules per gram which is written in short form as kj g . thus . the common unit of measuring calorific value is kilojoules per gram kj g . please note that the calorific value of a fuel represents the heat value of the fuel . the calorific values of some common fuels are given below .

atmospheric refraction you know that the earth is surrounded by a layer of air called the atmosphere . the density of air in the atmosphere is not the same everywhere . in general . it is greatest at the earth s surface and goes on decreasing as we move higher . the refractive index of air depends on its density higher the density of air . greater its refractive index . under standard conditions of temperature . humidity . etc . . near the earth s surface . the refractive index of air is slightly greater than . it decreases with height . and is very close to in the outermost region of the atmosphere . the changes in refractive index of air give rise to many phenomena . for example . a rising current of hot air makes the objects viewed through it seem to flicker . you might have seen this happen as hot air rises above the heated surface of roads on hot summer days or above a large burning stove or chulha . hot air has less density . and hence . less refractive index than normal or cold air . at a point in the area above a hot surface . the refractive index keeps on changing as currents of hot air passes through it . so . the amount by which light passing through it is bent keeps on changing . this makes the objects viewed through this area seem to sway or flicker . 
thus . m i in terms of v and f v v v m v or Ð¸ or f or or m ii in terms of u and f u v f Ð¸ u Ð¸ u Ð¸ v or f or or m u f utf u if iml . then image is of same size as is object . if im . then image is magnified . if im . then image is diminished . the formula m is valid for convex as well as concave mirror and it is independent of nature of object real or virtual irrespective of its position . magnification can be either positive or negative depending on the nature of the image . if m is negative . then image is inverted with respect to object and if m is positive then image is erect with respect to object . real image is not always inverted and virtual image is not always erect .

the phenomenon of producing electric current by moving a magnet near a coil is called electromagnetic induction .
 . the vegetation which is submerged under water at the dam site rots under anaerobic conditions and produces a large amount of methane which is a greenhouse gas and hence harmful for the environment . the opposition to the construction of tehri dam on the river ganga and sardar sarovar project on the river narmada are due to such problems . so . before taking a decision to generate hydroelectricity by constructing high rise dams on rivers . it is necessary to consider its long term effects on the environment and social life carefully .
a current would also be created in figure . . if the magnet were held stationary and the coil were moved . because the magnetic field at the coil would be changing as the coil approached or receded from the magnet .
when we increase the current through the conductor . we find that the deflection of the compass needle increases . this means that the magnitude of magnetic field around the conductor increases as the current through it is increased . when we move the compass away from the conductor we find that the deflection of the compass needle decreases . thus . the magnetic field produced by a given current in the conductor decreases as the distance from it increases .

presbyopia in old age . the ciliary muscles become weak and are not able to contract enough to decrease the focal length adequately . in this case also . objects at the normal near point are not focused on the retina . when far sightedness occurs due to this reason . it is called presbyopia . correcting far sightedness to see an object placed at the normal near point . n . clearly . its sharp image should be formed on the retina . for this . the rays should seem to be coming from n . the near point of the defective eye . to do this . the rays are made less divergent by placing a convex lens in front of the eye figure . c . rays of light coming from n pass through the convex lens . when produced backwards . the emergent rays meet at the point n . thus . a sharp image is formed on the retina .
figure a . now . without moving our head . we pour water into the basin . we will find that on adding water . the coin appears to rise and we are able to see it see figure b . the coin under water appears to be raised and becomes visible due to the refraction of light which takes place when it goes from water into air . we will now understand all this more clearly with the help of a ray diagram .

newton s third law of motion according to which if a current carrying wire exerts a force on a magnet . then the magnet will exert an equal and opposite force on the current carrying wire . in . faraday discovered that when a current carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field . a mechanical force is exerted on the conductor which can make the conductor move . this is known as the motor principle and forms the basis of a large number of electrical devices like electric motor and moving coil galvanometer . we will now describe an experiment to demonstrate the force exerted by a magnet on a current carrying wire and to show how the direction of force is related to the direction of current and the direction of magnetic field .

point o . so it does not bend on entering the glass slab or on coming out of the glass slab . it goes straight in the direction aobc . since the incident ray goes along the normal to the surface . the angle of incidence in this case is zero and the angle of refraction is also zero .
the design of a nuclear power plant is basically the same as that of a power plant that burns fossil fuel except that the burners are replaced by a reactor core . in both instances . steam is used to drive a turbine connected to an electrical generator .
the si unit of electric charge is coulomb which is denoted by the letter c . we can define this unit of charge as follows one coulomb is that quantity of electric charge which exerts a force of x newtons on an equal charge placed at a distance of metre from it . we now know that all the matter contains positively charged particles called protons and negatively charged particles called electrons . a proton possesses a positive charge of . x c whereas an electron possesses a negative charge of . x c . it is obvious that the unit of electric charge called coulomb is much bigger than the charge of a proton or an electron . this point will become more clear from the following example .
finding new sources of energy is essential for us to overcome the energy crisis .

magnification produced by lenses the size of image formed by a lens depends on the position of the object from the lens . for example . the image formed by a convex lens can be smaller than the object . equal to the object or bigger than the object . the size of the image relative to the object is given by the linear magnification . the linear magnification is the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the object . that is magnification height of image height of object
the resistivities of alloys are much more higher than those of the pure metals from which they are made . for example . the resistivity of manganin which is an alloy of copper . manganese and nickel is about times more than that of copper and the resistivity of constantan which is an alloy of copper and nickel is about times more than that of copper metal . it is due to their high resistivities that manganin and constantan alloys are used to make resistance wires or resistors used in electronic appliances to reduce the current in an electrical circuit . another alloy having a high resistivity is nichrome . this is an

two equal and opposite forces acting at different position of the armature coil constitute a couple . this couple rotates the coil in clockwise direction until the coil is in the vertical position as shown in figure a . at this position . the contacts of commutator and brushes break . so the supply of current to the coil is cut off . hence . no force acts on the arms of the coil . but the coil goes on rotating due to the inertia of motion of the coil until commutator again comes in contact with the brushes b and b .
please note that different types of glass have different chemical compositions due to which they have somewhat different values of refractive indices . because of this reason no single value can be given for the refractive index of all types of glass . the refractive index of glass usually varies from . to . . another point to be noted is that diamond has a very high refractive index of . .
working of a dc motor look at figure . a . the brush b is connected to the positive terminal of the battery . and b is connected to the negative terminal . so . a current flows in the coil along abcd a b d . figure . b shows the position of the coil after half a rotation from the initial position . as a result of the rotation . the brushes with which the two halves of the commutator were in contact have got interchanged . this has reversed the battery connections to the two arms of the coil . therefore . the current now flows along dcba . that is . the direction of the current in the two arms of the coil has got reversed . such a change takes place for each half rotation . in this way . the commutator changes the direction of the current in the coil after each half rotation . the two arms of the coil carry a current in a magnetic field . so . each arm experiences a force . the directions of the forces are shown by the grey arrows in the figure . in the position shown in figure . a . the arm ab experiences a downward force . while the arm cd experiences an upward force . this may be verified using fleming s left hand rule . the coil rotates in the anticlockwise direction because of these forces . after half a rotation . the direction of the current in the coil is reversed . as explained above . using fleming s left hand rule . we find that the arm ab now experiences an upward force . and the arm cd experiences a downward force . so . the coil continues to rotate in the anticlockwise direction . if the commutator is not used . the direction of current in an arm of the coil will always remain the same . so . the direction of the force on the arm will not change . and the coil will not be able to

this shows that when a charged particle moves in a magnetic field it too experiences a force . fleming s left hand rule is also used to find the direction of force experienced by a charge moving in a magnetic field . the direction of current in the rule is the direction in which a positive charge will move .
this rule is depicted in figure . a . to apply the rule . hold the current carrying conductor in your right hand such that the thumb points in the direction of current in the wire . now . curl your fingers as shown in figure . a around the wire . the direction of the fingers at any point around the wire gives the direction of the magnetic field lines at that point . in figure . a . the current is flowing upwards . when we curl the fingers around the wire we find that they curl in the anticlockwise direction . therefore . the magnetic field lines at a distance r from the conductor are also anticlockwise .
concentrator type solar cooker such solar energy devices which reflect and concentrate solar energy from over a large area into a small area are called solar concentrators .
concave lens a diverging lens can be supposed to be made up of a number of prisms with the base of each prism away from the centre of the lens . the central portion of the lens is a simple parallel sided glass slab which allows the ray of light to pass undeviated . as can be seen from figure . . the prisms in the upper part of the lens . deviate the rays of light towards their base i . e . . upwards whereas the prisms in the lower part of the lens deviate the rays towards their base i . e . . downwards . these rays seem to come from a point on the same side from where light is incident of the lens . this point is called the focus of the lens . thus . a concave lens diverges a parallel beam of light incident on it .

some properties of light light does not need a material medium to travel . i . e . . it can travel through a vacuum too . the best example of this is light travelling from the sun to the earth across vast expanses of space that have no material or matter . compare this with sound . which is also a wave . sound needs a material medium to travel . light waves travel at a tremendous speed whose value scientists have fixed at . . m s . according to current scientific theories . no material particle can travel at a speed greater than that of light . the light that enables us to see has a very small wavelength less than ten thousandth part of a centimetre . in comparison . the wavelength of audible sound is of the order of a few centimetres to a few metres .
known as a diverging lens because it diverges a parallel beam of light rays see figure . since the light rays do not actually pass through the focus of a concave lens . a concave lens has a virtual focus . in figure . the distance cf is the focal length of concave lens . the distance cf is also equal to the focal length . a yet another term which is used in the study of spherical lenses is aperture . the aperture of a spherical lens convex lens or concave lens is the surface from which refraction of light takes place through the lens . the aperture of spherical lens is represented by its diameter . in most simple words . mple words . figure . this picture shows that light diverges or spreads aperture tells us the size of the lens . after passing through a concave lens . s
case . when the object is at f object at f by saying that the object is placed at f . we mean that the object is at a distance equal to twice the focal length of the convex lens . in other words . the object is placed at a distance f from the convex lens . figure shows an object ab placed at a distance f twice the focal length . from a convex lens . a ray of light ad which is parallel to the principal axis passes through the focus f after refraction and goes in the direction df see figure . another ray of light ac passing through the optical centre c of the lens . goes straight and meets the first refracted ray at point a . on the right side of the lens . thus . a is the real image of point a of the object . we draw a b perpendicular to the axis to get the complete image a b . we find that the image a b is formed at f . at a distance f on the right side
an artificial magnet is one . which is made by man by magnetising small pieces of iron or nickel .
please note that if the direction of current in the front face of a circular wire is clockwise . then the direction of current in the back face of this circular wire will be anticlockwise and vice versa . this means that the front face of this current carrying circular wire will be a south pole but its back face will be a north pole . for example . the direction of current in the front face of current carrying circular wire shown in figure is clockwise . so the front face of this current carrying circular wire will be a south magnetic pole s pole . if . however . we view the current carrying circular wire given in figure from back side . we will find that the direction of current flowing in the back face of this circular wire is anticlockwise . due to this . the back face of this current carrying circular wire will be a north magnetic pole n pole . the clock

limitations the rise and fall of water during tides is not high enough to generate electrical energy on a large scale . there are very few places suitable for building dams . it is for these reasons . the tidal energy is not likely to be a major source of energy .
it is worth remembering that the emf induced in the generator depends upon the following factors i the number of turns greater the number of turns greater is the emf induced . ii the strength of the magnetic field stronger the magnetic field greater is the emf induced . iii the speed of rotation greater the speed of rotation greater is the induced emf .
the thumb points gives the direction of motion of the conductor . thus . we can write fleming s left hand rule in another way as follows hold the forefinger . the centre finger and the thumb of your left hand at right angles to one another . adjust your hand in such a way that the forefinger points in the direction of magnetic field and the centre finger points in the direction of current in the conductor . then the direction in which the thumb points gives the direction of motion of the conductor . to memorize fleming s left hand rule we should remember that the forefinger represents the magnetic field both . forefinger and field . start with the same letter f . the centre finger represents current both . centre and current start with letter c . and the thumb represents force or motion both . thumb and motion contain the letter m . we will make the fleming s left hand rule more clear by taking an example .

side . the reflected rays df and ec are produced backwards as shown by dotted lines . on producing backwards . they appear to intersect at point a behind the concave mirror . thus . a is the virtual image of point a of the object . to get the complete image of the object we draw a b perpendicular to the axis from point a . thus a b is the image of the object ab formed by the concave mirror . now . an eye at position x . sees the reflected rays as if they have come from points a b behind the mirror . since there is no actual intersection of the reflected rays . so the image a b is a virtual image . this image can be seen only by looking into the concave mirror . it cannot be obtained on a screen . we can see from figure that the image is same side up as object both of them have arrow head at the top . so it is an erect image . and if we compare the size of the object ab and its image a b . the image appears to be bigger in size than the object . thus . it is an enlarged image or magnified image . from the above discussion we conclude that when an object is placed between the pole p and focus f of a concave mirror . the image formed is i behind the mirror . ii virtual and erect . and iii larger than the object or magnified .

when light rays go from air or vacuum into another medium . then they bend or refract to some extent . now . some media bend the light rays more than the others . the refractive index of a medium gives an indication of the light bending ability of that medium . for example . the refractive index of glass is greater than the refractive index of water . therefore . the light rays bend more on passing from air into glass than from air into water . we will now solve one problem based on refractive index .

dispersion of light we see colours all around us . the blue sky . green leaves . red roses . yellow sunflowers . colourful birds and butterflies . etc . . are just some of the colours we see in nature . and then we have the colours of our clothes . pens . pencils . houses . vehicles . and so on . the colours we see depend on the colour of light entering our eyes from an object or a source of light . different sources of light may produce lights of different colours . a sodium vapour lamp . for example . produces a yellowish light . the flame of a gas stove emits blue light . but sunlight does not appear to have a colour . the same is true of certain types of bulbs we use at home . we call such light i . e . . those that appear colourless white light . though white light does not appear coloured . it is actually a mixture of lights of different colours present in a definite proportion . lights of different colours have different wavelengths . so . they behave differently . for example . they travel at different speeds in any material medium . this makes the refractive index of a transparent material slightly different for different colours of lights . so . lights of different colours bend by different amounts on refraction . therefore . under certain conditions . when white light gets refracted . its components bend by different amounts and separate out . you must have seen this happen when sunlight passing through a glass of water falls on the table or the floor . producing a band of colours . the phenomenon of splitting of light into its component colours due to the dependence of refractive index on wavelength is called the dispersion of light .
when the commutator comes in contact with brushes b . and b after rotation . the direction of the current in arms ab and cd is reversed as shown in figure b . the force acting on arm ab is in the downward direction and the force acting on the arm cd is in the upward direction . again these two equal and opposite forces again constitute a couple and again rotates the coil in the clockwise direction . thus . the coil of d . c . motor continues to rotate in the same direction . hence . electrical energy is converted into mechanical energy i . e . . kinetic energy of rotation . the speed of rotation of the motor can be increased by a increasing the strength of the current through the armature . b increasing the number of turns in the coil of the armature . c increasing the area of coil . and d increasing the strength of the magnetic field .

a small hole was made in the screen on which the entire spectrum was formed such that only the green portion of the spectrum could pass through it . the green wavelength was then allowed to fall on another dispersing prism as shown in figure . . after refraction through the prism this green light was allowed to fall on a screen . it was found that the light obtained on the white screen had the same colour as that of the light falling on the dispersing prism . this showed that the prism does not produce any colour of its own it simply splits the white light into its constituent wavelengths .
 do you know there are million rod cells and million cone cells on the retina . some animals have their two eyes on the opposite sides of head . i . e . . one in the front and other at the back of head . this gives a much wider field of view .
the answer is a phenomenon called electromagnetic induction if magnetic field more appropriately magnetic flux through a circuit changes . a potential difference voltage and a current are induced in a circuit . the potential difference is called induced potential difference and the current is called induced current . in other words . whenever there is relative motion between a conductor and a magnetic field an induced potential or potential difference and induced current is produced . when electromagnetic induction was discovered in the s . it was a mere laboratory curiosity today . thanks to its central role in the generation of electric power . it is fundamentally responsible for the nature of our technological society .

geothermal energy geothermal energy means energy stored as heat in the earth . you know that below the earth s crust lies a layer called the mantle . the temperature near the upper part of the mantle is around hot spring c . the material here is in a partially geyser molten state and is called magma . in some areas . hot magma swells up into the crust . but remains trapped hot underground below the surface of the earth . such areas in the earth s crust are called hot spots . the rocks and groundwater above these hot spots get heated . at some places . the magma hot water comes to the surface and collects in pools called hot springs . in fig . . geysers and hot springs water

ui since the resistance of a wire or conductor is inversely proportional to its area of cross section . therefore . when the area of cross section of a wire is doubled . its resistance gets halved and if the area of cross section of wire is halved . then its resistance will get doubled . we know that a thick wire has a greater area of cross section whereas a thin wire has a smaller area of cross section . this means that a thick wire has less resistance . and a thin wire has more resistance . a thick wire having large area of cross section can be considered equivalent to a large number of thin wires connected in parallel . and we know that if we have two resistance wires connected in parallel . their resultant resistance is halved . so . doubling the area of cross section of a wire will . therefore . halve the resistance . from the m studygear above discussion it is clear that to make resistance wires or resistors do i short length of a thick wire is used for getting low resistance . and ii long length of a thin wire is used for getting high resistance .
shorter by about minutes if the earth had no atmosphere . the sun appears flattened or oval at sunrise and sunset . the apparent flattening of the sun s disc at sunrise and sunset is also due to atmospheric refraction . we will study this in detail in higher classes . before we go further and discuss scattering of light . please answer the following questions 
when light falls on a smooth surface . a part of it gets reflected . figure . shows a ray of light being reflected from a flat . smooth surface . the ray ao is incident on the surface at point o and is reflected along ob . the line on is the normal to the surface at o . this means . on is perpendicular to the surface . the angle aon that the incident ray makes with the normal is called the angle of incidence . commonly denoted by i . and the angle bon that the reflected ray makes with the normal is called the angle of reflection . commonly denoted by r . the reflection of light follows two laws .
the value of current flowing through the nichrome wire ab . the voltmeter reading is noted which gives the potential difference v across the ends of the nichrome wire ab . this gives the first set of v and i reading . let us say vá» and . the current in the circuit is now increased step by step by changing the position of the contact point c of the rheostat . record the value of the current by reading the ammeter and the corresponding value of the potential difference by reading the voltmeter in all the cases . the ratio is calculated for all the readings . record your observations . result is the ratio potential difference current calculated for all the readings . it is found that the ratio has almost constant value for all the observations . this verifies ohm s law because this shows that the current is directly proportional to the potential difference .

conventional and nonconventional sources of energy sources of energy that have been in use for centuries are called conventional sources of energy . conventional sources include wood . coal . petroleum and flowing water . conventional sources like coal and petroleum are nonrenewable . while sources like flowing water are renewable . sources of energy that we have started using in new ways or only in recent times are called nonconventional or alternate sources of energy . these include energy from the sun . the heat inside the earth geothermal energy . tides . ocean waves . etc . nuclear energy is also a nonconventional source . note that nonconventional energy sources are renewable . our government has started giving great attention to these sources . we have been using wind and biomass like cow dung for energy for ages . in that sense they are conventional sources . however . they were not used conventionally to do tasks like electricity generation . which has now been made possible with improvement in technology . in that sense set they can also be called nonconventional sources of energy .
experiment to demonstrate the magnetic effect of current we will now describe oersted s experiment to show that a current carrying wire produces a magnetic field around it . we take a thick insulated copper wire and fix it in such a way that the portion ab of the wire is in the north south direction as shown in figure a . a plotting compass m is placed under the wire ab . the two ends of the wire are connected to a battery through a switch . when no current is flowing in the wire ab . the compass needle is parallel to the wire ab and points in the usual north south direction figure a . m studygear o north north so zato current Å¡ plotting compass needle gets deflected switch compass b south south a b figure . experiment to show that an electric current produces a magnetic effect . let us pass the electric current through wire ab by pressing the switch . on passing the current we find that compass needle is deflected from its north south position as shown in figure b . and when the current is switched off . the compass needle returns to its original position . we know that a freely pivoted compass needle always sets itself in the north south direction . it deflects from its usual north south direction only when it is acted upon by another magnetic field . so . the deflection of compass needle by the current carrying wire in the above experiment shows that an electric current produces a magnetic field around it . it is this magnetic field which deflects the compass needle placed near the current carrying wire .
working of an ac generator to generate electricity . the shaft . on which the coil is mounted . is rotated . in figure . a . the arm ab of the coil is moving down . while the arm dc is moving up . fleming s right hand rule will show that the current in the coil is along dcba . from a . the current flows to d via c . b . p . q . b and c . so . the current through the bulb is from p to q . figure . b shows the situation after half a rotation . the arm ab is now moving up and the arm dc is moving down . this causes the current to flow along abcd . from d . the current flows to a via c . b . q . p . b and c . so . the current through the bulb is from q to a . thus . as the direction of the current in the arms of the coil changes with each half rotation . the direction of the current through the bulb changes . in other words . an alternating current flows through the bulb .
if we look at the screen on the front side of the glass tank containing colloidal solution of sulphur . we will see a red patch on the screen . this is because mainly the red colour of the beam of white light reaches the screen after passing through the colloidal sulphur solution in the glass tank the blue colour being scattered away and hence eliminated on the way . this is how the sun looks red at sunrise and sunset when mainly the red colour of sunlight reaches our eyes after the elimination of blue colour through scattering along the way . we are now in a position to answer the following questions 
in the past . wind energy was used through windmills to pump water or lift water from a well and to grind wheat into flour . this happened as follows when the blades of windmill rotate by the force of wind . a shaft connected to them also rotates . this rotating shaft was made to run a water pump to lift water from a well by a suitable mechanism . it could also turn the mill stones of a flour mill . the traditional use of wind energy has now been modified by the improvement in technology to generate electricity through wind powered generators . this is explained below .
reflection is of two types i diffuse reflection or irregular reflection and ii specular reflection or regular reflection . while studying the reflection of light we consider light to be a ray . a ray of light represents the direction of the propagation of light i . e . . light travels in the direction of the ray of light .
if Ð² be the reference point . the potential at b is vb . from equation . . the potential at a is va w q . so . the potential at a point is the work done per unit charge in taking a charge to that point from a chosen reference point . equation . may also be written as w qv . . . . . the work done on the charge q is stored as the electric potential energy u of the group of charges . so . u qv . . . . . unit of potential difference the unit of potential difference and potential is the volt . whose symbol is v . the volt is named in honour of the italian physicist alessandro volta . if joule of work is done in taking coulomb of charge from one point to another . the potential difference between the points is volt . v w joule v volt . q coulomb the potential difference between two points is sometimes also called the voltage .
 . effect of temperature it has been found that the resistance of all pure metals increases on raising the temperature and decreases on lowering the temperature . but the resistance of alloys like manganin . constantan and nichrome is almost unaffected by temperature .
 . the second law of refraction gives a relationship between the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction . this relationship was discovered by snell experimentally in . so the second law of refraction is called snell s law of refraction . according to snell s law of refraction of light the ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is constant for a given pair of media such as air and glass or air and water . that is sine of angle of incidence constant sine of angle of refraction sin i or sin r constant
formation of image light is bent by refractions at the cornea and the lens such that a sharp image is formed on the retina . the crystalline lens is made up of jellylike . fibrous substances that make it elastic . the ciliary muscles . to which the lens is attached . can alter the curvature and thickness of the lens . the average of the refractive indices of the materials of the lens is about . . the liquids in front of and behind the lens have a refractive index of about . . when light enters the eye from air . most of the bending occurs at the cornea itself because of the sharp change in refractive index . the difference in the refractive indices of the lens and the liquids surrounding it being smaller . light bends less at the lens . so . the lens just provides a kind of fine tuning . the cornea lens fluid system is equivalent to a single converging lens . which we shall call the eye lens . since the ciliary muscles can change the curvature of the crystalline lens . it in effect can change the focal length of the eye lens .
inwards whereas the force on cd acts outwards . these forces form a couple and hence apply a torque pair of forces on the coil that turns it . this is because the direction of current in the two sides is opposite to each other . eventually . the coil reaches the position shown in fig . b . in this position . the half rings momentarily lose electrical contact with the brushes . so that there is no current in the coil and no applied torque . however . like any moving object . the rotating coil does not stop immediately . for its inertia of motion carries it onward . when the half rings re establish contact with the brushes . there again is a current in the coil and a magnetic torque again rotates the coil in the same direction . this time the force on ab acts outwards and that on cd acts inwards . but this time the rings are in contact with different brushes . ring r . comes in contact with brush b and ring r comes in contact with brush bi .
colours of the sun you must have noticed that the colour of the sun changes during the day . at noon . when the sun is directly overhead . the distance ab travelled by sunlight through the atmosphere is short as compared to other times figure . . so . sunlight comes across lesser number of particles . resulting in lesser scattering . thus . around noon . the sun looks close to its actual colour . i . e . . white . at sunset or sunrise . sunlight has to travel a larger distance . cb . so . it comes across more number of particles which scatter mostly the bluish lights . thus . the light reaching our eyes has more of the reddish lights . this makes the sun look orange or red . earth fig . . sunlight travels through a large distance through the atmosphere when the sun is at the horizon .

nuclear fission in about power plants worldwide . electricity is produced from the energy liberated in a special type of nuclear reaction called nuclear fission . the word fission means to split or break up into parts . nuclear fission is a reaction in which a heavy nucleus splits into two middleweight nuclei . releasing a lot of energy . the process of a heavy nucleus splitting into two middleweight nuclei is called nuclear fission . one of the isotopes of uranium is u is its mass number . i . e . . the sum of the number of neutrons and protons . the nucleus of u can be used to start a nuclear fission reaction by bombarding it with slow moving neutrons . in this process . u itself does not undergo fission . it converts to u . which is highly unstable . as soon as it forms . u splits in two parts . i . e . . it fissions . some neutrons . generally or . are also emitted in this process . the nuclei of the elements formed by fission are unstable . they disintegrate further to form stable nuclei . gamma ray electromagnetic radiation and particles such as neutrons and electrons are emitted by the nuclei at different stages between the fission and the creation of stable nuclei . 
if a coil of copper tube painted black from outside is placed in a box similar to that of solar cooker . it will work as a solar water heater . this is because when water is passed through the copper coil . it will absorb sun s heat rays and become hot . solar water heaters are used to supply hot water in big buildings like hotels and hospitals . a solar water heater cannot be used to get hot water during the night or on a cloudy day . let us solve one problem now .
if bulbs of different wattages are joined in parallel . then highest wattage bulb glows with maximum brightness . if bulbs of different wattages are joined in series . then lowest wattage bulb glows with maximum brightness .
a cell provides a constant potential difference the potential difference provided by things like charged spheres reduces to zero quickly once charges start to flow . so . we have to use cells to provide constant potential difference for a long time . cells have chemicals inside . reactions in the cell cause positive and negative charges to gather separately . this creates a potential difference between the terminals of the cell . the
convex lens a converging lens can be supposed to be made up of a number of prisms with the base of each prism towards the centre of the lens . the central portion of the lens is a simple parallel sided glass slab which allows the ray of light to pass undeviated . as can be seen from figure . . the prisms in the upper part of the lens . deviate the rays of light towards their base i . e . . downwards whereas the prisms in the lower part of the lens deviate the rays towards their base i . e . . upwards . these rays converge at a point on the other side of the lens . this point is called the focus of the lens . thus . a concave lens converges a parallel beam of light incident on it .
potential difference the potential difference p . d . between two points in an electric field is defined as the amount of work done in moving a unit positive charge from one point to the other point . if w is the amount of work done in bringing a unit charge from one point to the other point then the potential difference va vb between two points is given by work done w potential difference va vb av charge av va vb the si unit of potential difference is volt which is denoted by v . one volt is the potential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor when joule of work is done to move a charge of coulomb from one point to the other .

electromagnet an iron nail or a bolt will not attract other iron or steel objects . but what happens if they are placed inside a solenoid carrying a current let us find out .
the images formed by the two surfaces of the spoon are similar to those formed by curved mirrors . we shall now learn about some types of curved mirrors .
force on current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field we have already described oersted s experiment which shows that a current carrying wire exerts a force on a compass needle and deflects it from its usual north south position . since a compass needle is actually a small freely pivoted magnet . we can also say that a current carrying wire exerts a mechanical force on a magnet . and if the magnet is free to move . this force can produce a motion in the magnet . the reverse of this is also true . that is . a magnet exerts a mechanical force on a current carrying wire . and if the wire is free to move . this force can produce a motion in the wire see figure . in fact . this result can be obtained by applying
it is also due to atmospheric refraction that we can still see the sun for about minutes even after the sun has set below horizon . from the above discussion we conclude that we can see the sun minutes before the actual sunrise time and for minutes after the actual sunset time . so . the time from sunrise to sunset is lengthened by about minutes because of atmospheric refraction . thus . the day would have been
solar energy the energy received from the sun is called solar energy . the sun is the ultimate source of energy of fossil fuels . flowing water . wind . biomass and ocean waves .
light is incident normally on a mirror . it means that it is travelling along the normal to the mirror . so . the angle of incidence i for such a ray of light is zero . and since the angle of incidence is zero . therefore . according to the second law of reflection . its angle of reflection r will also be zero . this means that a ray of light which is incident normally or perpendicularly on a mirror . is reflected back along the same path because the angle of incidence as well as the angle of reflection for such a ray of light are zero . for example . in figure . a ray of light falls on the plane mirror along the normal no . therefore . it will be reflected along the same path on . so . in this case . the incident ray ay will be no and the reflected ray will be on . in other words . the same line il be on . in other words . the same line represents incident ray . normal and reflected ray . we should . however . put two arrow heads on the same normal line pointing in opposite directions one arrow to represent incident ray and the other arrow to represent reflected ray as shown in figure .
the converging and the diverging lens are further of following types convex lenses . meniscus . . planoconvex . . double convex or bi convex figure . shows the different types of converging lenses . the double or bi convex lens has both the surface convex . the planoconvex has one convex surface and one plane surface while the convex meniscus or concavo convex lens has one surface concave and the other convex . all these lenses are thicker in the middle and thinner at the edges .
the lens systems consisting of several lenses in contact are used in designing the optical instruments like cameras . microscopes and telescopes . etc . the use of a combination of lenses increases the sharpness of the image . the image produced by using a combination of lenses is also free from many defects which otherwise occur while using a single lens . we will now solve a problem based on combination of lenses .
 water is also an optically denser medium than air . so when a ray of light goes from air into water . it bends towards the normal . thus . the refraction of light on going from air to water is similar to the refraction of light from air to glass which has been shown in figure . to show the path of a ray of light going from air into water . we can use figure but we will have to write water in
with metal ends fig . . the fuses used for domestic purposes are rated as a . a . a . a . a . etc . for an electric iron which consumes kw electric power when operated at v . a current of a . that is . . a will flow in the circuit . in this case . a a fuse must be used . the fuse rating is the maximum safe current permitted to flow in a fuse before it blows off . this saves the electrical device from damage .
power of a combination of lenses if a number of lenses are placed in close contact . then the power of the combination of lenses is equal to the algebraic sum of the powers of individual lenses . thus . if two lenses of powers p and p are placed in contact with each other . then their resultant power p is given by p p p for example . if a convex lens of power . d and a concave lens of power . d are placed in contact with each other . then their resultant power will be p p p d this shows that a combination of convex lens of power d and a concave lens of power . d has a resultant power of . d . so . this combination of convex lens and concave lens behaves like a concave lens of power . dioptres . this is shown clearly in the figure given below 
 . construction of ray diagrams each point on an object emits light rays in all directions . and when some of these rays pass through a lens . they form an image . as with mirrors . ray diagrams can be drawn to determine the location and size of the image .
also explains the use of a concave mirror as a shaving mirror . when the face is placed close to a concave mirror so that the face is within its focus the concave mirror produces a magnified large and erect image of the face . since a large image of the face is seen in the concave mirror . it becomes easier to make a smooth shave . thus . while using a concave mirror as a shaving mirror . the face should be close to the concave mirror . for the same reason . concave mirrors are also used as make up mirrors by women for putting on make up such as painting eye lashes see figure b . in order to use a concave mirror as a make up mirror . the face is held close to the concave mirror so that it lies within the focus of concave mirror . dentists use concave mirrors to see the large image of the teeth for examining the teeth of a person see figure c . for this purpose . the dentist holds a small concave mirror in such a way that the tooth lies within its focus . a magnified image of the tooth is then seen by the dentist in the concave mirror . since the tooth looks much bigger . it becomes easy to examine the defect in the tooth .

 . nuclear fusion the word fusion means to join or to combine . the process in which two nuclei of light elements like that of hydrogen combine to form a heavy nucleus like that of helium . is called nuclear fusion . a tremendous amount of energy is produced during the fusion process . we know that the nuclei of atoms are positively charged . so . when two nuclei are brought together . they repel each other due to their similar charges . due to this a lot of initial heat energy and high pressure are required to force the lighter nuclei to fuse together to form a bigger nucleus . so . the conditions needed for carrying out nuclear fusion process are millions of degrees of temperature and millions of pascals of pressure . in other words . nuclear fusion is carried out by heating the lighter atoms to extremely high temperatures under extremely high pressure . there is some loss of mass during the fusion process which appears as a tremendous amount of energy . here is an example of nuclear fusion reaction .
it is obvious that we should have some device which may disconnect the electricity supply when a short circuit or overloading occurs so that the electric fires are prevented in our homes . to avoid this danger of electric fires we use an electric fuse in the wiring . so . when a building is wired . the wiring is protected by fuses . we will now describe what a fuse is and how it works .
 . . . limitations of wind energy although wind energy has many advantages . it also has its limitations . following are the limitations of wind energy . wind has a very low energy density . . favourable winds are available only in a few geographical areas away from cities . the velocity required for a windmill to function is about km h . backup facilities needed to take care of energy needs in the absence of winds . . direction of wind changes and is never the same . . wind farms require flat . vacant land free from forests . . the construction cost of wind farms is very high . . a wind farm requires a high degree of maintenance .
direct use involves using the heat in the water directly without a heat pump or power plant . this is used for heating buildings . industrial processes . greenhouses . fish farms . food processing facilities . gold mining operations . and a variety of other applications . this direct use of geothermal energy in homes and commercial operations results in savings of upto per cent over fossil fuels .

magnetic field lines a line such that the tangent at any point on it gives the direction of the magnetic field at that point is called a magnetic field line or magnetic line of force .
house wiring there are two systems of wiring by which the power is distributed to a house a the tree system b the ring system . we shall be describing the tree system of wiring though the ring system is rapidly replacing the tree system . in tree system of wiring . different branch lines are taken out from the distribution board to different parts of the house in much the same way as the branches from the trunk of a tree . each branch line is taken to a room through a fuse in the live wire .
regular reflection and diffuse reflection of light in regular reflection . a parallel beam of incident light is reflected as a parallel beam in one direction . in this case . parallel incident rays remain parallel even after reflection and go only in one direction see figure . regular reflection of light occurs from smooth surfaces like that of a plane mirror or highly polished metal surfaces . for example . when a parallel beam of light falls on the smooth surface of a plane mirror . it is reflected as a parallel beam in only one direction as shown in figure . thus . a plane mirror produces regular reflection of light . images are formed by regular reflection of light . for example . a

the collection of coloured components produced by splitting light is called spectrum .
 . non renewable sources of energy those sources of energy which have accumulated in nature over a very . very long time and cannot be quickly replaced when exhausted are called non renewable sources of energy . for example . coal is a non renewable source of energy because coal has accumulated in the earth over a very . very long time . and if all the coal gets exhausted . it cannot be produced quickly in nature see figure . the non renewable sources of energy are fossil fuels coal . petroleum and natural gas . and nuclear fuels such as uranium . non renewable sources of energy are dug out from the earth .
 i the object is always placed towards the left of the mirror such that light propagates from the left towards the right side .
activity verification of ohm s law take four or five dry cells . a thin wire ab . a voltmeter . an ammeter . a plug key and some thick connecting wires . connect the circuit as shown in figure . a . using one cell . the plug key allows you to switch off the current when not required . the wire becomes quite hot when current passes through it for some time . this drains the cell as well . therefore . insert the key into the plug to switch on the current only when taking measurements . the ammeter measures the current i through the circuit . and the voltmeter measures the potential difference v between the ends a and b of the wire . note these values . now connect two cells in series in the circuit . as shown in figure . b . you will find that the reading of the voltmeter increases . indicating the fact that a larger potential difference has been applied across the wire ab . you will also find that the reading of the ammeter increases as well . note down the new values of v and i . repeat the experiment by connecting in series three celis . four cells . and so on . in each case measure the potential difference and the current . if you calculate v i for each . you will find that it is almost the same . so . v i r is a constant . which is another way of stating ohm s law . here . ris the resistance of the wire ab . if you plot a graph of the current i against the potential difference v . it will be a straight line figure . c . this shows that the current is proportional to the potential difference . a b fig . .

reflection of light when light falls on the surface of an object . some of it is sent back . the process of sending back the light rays which fall on the surface of an object . is called reflection of light . the reflection of light is shown in figure . when a beam of light ao falls on a mirror at point o . it is sent back by the mirror in another direction ob see figure . and we say that the mirror has reflected the beam of light falling on it . we can compare the reflection of light to the bouncing back of a tennis ball on hitting a wall . for example . if we throw a tennis ball at a wall . the ball bounces back . this means that the wall sends it back . similarly . when light falls on the surface of an object . the object sends the light back . and we say that the object

in figure . a . h . is positive but he is negative . in figure . b . both h . and he are positive . why is this sign convention called the coordinate convention it is called so because if . by convention . we always keep the object to the left of the pole and above the principal axis . the signs of the quantities u . v . f and r follow the same rules followed for representing the x coordinates of points using coordinate axes . you can think of the pole as the origin . the principal axis as the x axis and a line perpendicular to it as the y axis . the left to right direction is taken as the positive direction of the x axis . then you can think of u . v . f and r as the x coordinates of the object . image . focus and centre of curvature respectively . thus . if any of these is to the left of the pole origin . its x coordinate is negative . similarly . if any of these is to the right of the pole . its x coordinate is positive . since the object . by convention . is always placed to the left of the mirror . its x coordinate u is always negative . in both cases shown in figure . . u pa . in figure . a . the image a . the focus f and the centre of curvature c are all to the left of the origin p . so . v . f and r are also negative . and are equal to pa . pf and pc respectively . in figure . b . the image is to the right of the origin . hence . its x coordinate v is positive . similarly . f and r are also positive .
electromagnet . when an electric current is passed through a solenoid that has a core of a magnetic material like iron . the core becomes an electromagnet . the magnetism disappears when the current is stopped . the poles can be switched by reversing the direction of the current . the cores of electromagnets use soft magnetic materials like soft iron . this is to ensure that the electromagnet loses its magnetism once the current is switched off . permanent magnets are made of hard magnetic materials like alnico .

need for earthing of electrical appliances many electric appliances of daily use like electric press . heater . toaster . refrigerator . table fan etc . have a metallic body . if the insulation of any of these appliances melts and makes contact with the metallic casing . the person touching it is likely to receive a severe electric shock . this is due to the reason that the metallic casing will be at the same potential as the applied one . obviously . the electric current will flow through the body of the person who touches the appliance . to avoid such serious accidents . the metal casing of the electric appliance is earthed . since the earth does not offer any resistance . the current flows to the earth through the earth wire instead of flowing through the body of the person . also . due to very low resistance almost nil offered by the earth wire . the current in the circuit rises to a very high value . thereby melting fuse in that circuit and cutting off its electric supply .

energy . as you know . is the capacity to do work . you also know that in a given situation when all forms of energy are taken into account . the total energy remains constant . energy can neither be created nor destroyed it can only be changed from one form to another . yet you hear about energy production . energy crisis . need to conserve energy . and so on . the term energy used in these has a slightly different meaning . in these expressions . we refer to the energy in a useful form that we can use to cook . operate machines and appliances . run vehicles . and so on . we cannot put to use the energy available from every source . we can only put to use energy from specific sources . which we call sources of energy . for example . the potential energy of a rock high up on a hill cannot be used to cook food . but the chemical energy in cooking gas liquefied petroleum gas . lpg can . so . the rock is not a source of energy . but lpg is . some common sources of energy include firewood . coal . petroleum . natural gas . flowing water and uranium . we also use the energy of the sun and the wind . so . they are also energy sources .
then by ohm s law . the potential drop across each resistor is given by vi ir . v ir and v i rz . since v is the total potential difference in the circuit . therefore . by conservation of energy . we have v v v v . . . . substituting for v v and v in equation . . we have v i r i r i r . . . if rg is the equivalent resistance of the series combination . then by ohm s law . we have v irs . . . . therefore . from equations . and . . we have i rs i r i r i rz hence . rs r r rz . . . . thus . in series combination the equivalent resistance is the sum of the three individual resistances .

of force on the current carrying wire has been reversed . from this we conclude that the direction of force on a current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field can be reversed by reversing the direction of current flowing in the conductor . keeping the direction of current unchanged . if we reverse the direction of magnetic field applied in figure by turning the magnet m so that its poles are reversed . even then the wire swings backwards showing that the direction of force acting on it has been reversed . thus . the direction of force on a current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field can also be reversed by reversing the direction of magnetic field .
white light is a mixture of coloured lights . the phenomenon of splitting of light into its component colours due to the dependence of refractive index on wavelength is called the dispersion of light . a prism causes light to be split into its component colours . the angle through which a ray of light turns on passing through a prism is called the angle of deviation . the collection of coloured components produced by splitting of light is called spectrum .

at hydroelectric power house . the generator is driven by the power of fast flowing water released from a dam across a river . in thermal power house . the generator is driven by the power of high pressure steam . the heat energy for making steam from water comes from burning coal . natural gas or oil . at nuclear power house . the heat energy for making steam comes from nuclear reactions taking place inside the nuclear reactor . the high pressure steam turns a turbine . the turbine turns the generator . and the generator converts mechanical energy or kinetic energy into electrical energy or electricity . this electricity is then supplied to our homes .
when newton performed this experiment . he proved that the colour was not added by the prism . but the colours were present in white light and the glass prism served simply to separate the colours .
we will also be using rays of light in constructing the ray diagrams . a ray of light is the straight line along which light travels . the arrow head put on the straight line tells us the direction in which the light is travelling . a bundle of light rays is called a beam of light . we will now study the reflection of light from the plane surfaces like that of a plane mirror . this is necessary to understand the reflection of light from spherical mirrors .
a fuse is a safety device having a short length of a thin . tin plated copper wire having low melting point . which melts and breaks the circuit if the current exceeds a safe value . the thickness and length of the fuse wire depends on the maximum current allowed through the circuit . an electric fuse works on the heating effect of current . the fuse for protecting our domestic wiring is fitted just above our main switch on the switch board . a fuse wire is connected in series in the electric circuits .
 . the heating effect of electric current is utilised in electric fuse for protecting household wiring and electrical appliances . a fuse is a short length of a thin tin plated copper wire having low melting point . the thin fuse wire has a higher resistance than the rest of the electric wiring in a house . so . when the current in a household electric circuit rises too much due to some reason . then the fuse wire gets heated too much . melts and breaks the circuit due to which the current stops flowing . this prevents the fire in house due to over heating of wiring and also prevents damage to various electrical appliances in the house due to excessive current flowing through them . thus . an electric fuse is a very important application of the
principle of generation of hydroelectricity potential energy of water stored in a dam is converted into kinetic energy of the falling water . the water falls on the turbine . so kinetic energy of the flowing water is converted into the kinetic energy of the armature of the generator connected to the turbine . then kinetic energy is converted into the electrical energy known as hydroelectricity .
 . large eco systems are destroyed when land is submerged under the water of reservoir of a dam . the construction of dam on a river also disturbs the ecological balance in the downstream area of the river . for example . due to the construction of dam there are no annual floods in the river . and because of this the soil of downstream region does not get nutrient rich silt . this decreases the fertility of soil in the downstream area and finally the crop yields also decrease .
the si unit of resistance is ohm which is denoted by the symbol omega . . the unit of resistance ohm . can be defined by using ohm s law as described below . according to ohm s law potential difference resistance a constant current that is . r so . resistance . r now . if the potential difference v is volt and the current i is ampere . then resistance r in the above equation becomes ohm . volt that is . ohm ampere this gives us the following definition for ohm ohm is the resistance of a conductor such that when a potential difference of volt is applied to its ends . a current of ampere flows through it . we can find out the resistance of a conductor by using ohm s law equation r . this will become more clear from the following examples .

by saying that the object is at the focus of a convex lens . we mean that the object is at a distance equal to the focal length f of the lens . figure shows an object ab placed at the focus f of a convex lens . a parallel ray of light ad passes through the focus f after refraction and goes along the path dx . another ray ac passing through the centre c of the lens goes straight in the direction cy . the two refracted rays dx and cy are parallel to one another . these parallel rays will intersect or meet at a far off distance to form an image at infinity . and since the image is formed at infinity . it is not possible to show it in our diagram . it
for example . in figure a . the current in a face of the circular wire is flowing in the clockwise direction . so this face of current carrying circular wire will behave as a south magnetic pole or s pole . on the other hand . in figure b the current in the face of the circular wire is flowing in the anticlockwise direction . so this face of current carrying circular wire will behave as a north magnetic pole or n pole .

ordinary white light is a superposition of waves of wavelengths extending throughout the visible spectrum . the speed of light in vacuum is same for all wavelengths . but the speed in a material substance is different for different wavelengths . as a result different colours are deviated by different angles when they pass through a prism . this is called dispersion of light . hence . the splitting of white light into its constituent seven colours is called dispersion of light fig . .

hydro energy is easily storable . conventional renewable energy . it is also solar energy in another form . solar energy is incident on the water in the oceans which evaporates and forms clouds . these clouds take water in the form of small droplets to distant places due to air currents . this converts the solar energy into the potential energy of the water droplets . during rainfall this potential energy of water droplets is converted into kinetic energy and the
 . magnetic field lines the concept of magnetic field lines was put forward by michael faraday in order to explain the interaction between the poles separated by some distance . the magnetic force is action at a distance force . which can be best understood by the lines of forces or field lines . according to faraday . a magnet modifies the space around itself in such a manner that if any other magnetic substance moves into this space it experiences a force . this is termed as the magnetic force . the region itself is termed as the magnetic field of the magnet . a magnetic field around a magnet can be visualised by drawing magnetic field lines around the magnet . a magnetic field line is a path straight or curved . the tangent to which at any point gives the direction the magnetic field at that point .
left to right . since the incident light always goes from left to right . all the distances measured from the pole p of mirror to the right side will be considered positive because they will be in the same direction as the incident light . on the other hand . all the distances measured from pole p of mirror to the left side will be negative because they are measured against the direction of incident light .
common measuring instruments the electric current in a circuit is measured by an instrument called the ammeter . and the potential difference between two points in it is measured by a voltmeter . you might have seen these meters in voltage stabilizers . in these meters . a needle moving over a graduated scale gives the value of the measured quantity . each meter has two terminals . the terminal marked is connected by a wire to the higher potential side of a circuit . while the terminal marked is connected to the lower potential side .
the exact speed of light in vacuum is . x m s and that in air is . x m s . we can see that the speed of light in air is almost the same as that in vacuum . so for the purpose of determining refractive index we can also treat air as if it were vacuum . so . the refractive index of a medium or substance with respect to air is also considered to be its absolute refractive index . thus . airnglass can also be written as nglass . the absolute refractive index of a medium or substance is just called its refractive index .

 . ocean thermal energy a very large area of sea is called an ocean . the water at the surface of an ocean gets heated by the heat of the sun and attains a higher temperature than the colder water at deeper levels in the ocean . so . there is always a temperature difference between the water at the surface of ocean and at deeper levels . the energy available due to the difference in the temperature of water at the surface of the ocean and at deeper levels is called ocean thermal energy ote . the ocean thermal energy can be converted into a usable form of energy like electricity . this can be done as follows

some of the phenomena of light can be explained only if light is considered to be made up of waves whereas others can be explained only if light is thought to be made up of particles . for example . the phenomena of diffraction bending of light around the corners of tiny objects . interference and polarization of light can only be explained if light is considered to be of wave nature . the particle theory of light cannot explain these phenomena . on the other hand . the phenomena of reflection and refraction of light . and casting of shadows of objects by light . can be explained only if light is thought to be made of particles . wave theory of light cannot explain these phenomena . thus . there is evidence for the wave nature of light as well as for particle nature of light .

again . this action is repeated as long as the current is passed in wire ab . it should be noted that the current carrying wire is kicked forward because a force is exerted on it by the magnetic field of the u shaped magnet . from this experiment we conclude that when a current carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field . a mechanical force is exerted on the conductor which makes it move .

you may question . then why planets do not twinkle the reason is simple . the stars . although very large as compared to the planets . appear as tiny specks in the sky due to their immense distance from the earth as compared to the huge size of the planets . thus . the stars appear as point sources of light and the planets appear as a large combination of such sources . thus . the change in the path of light coming from the planets is negligible as compared to that coming from the stars . therefore . the planets do not seem to twinkle like star .
this defect arises due to the weakening of the ciliary muscles and the decreasing flexibility of the eye lens . sometimes an old person may suffer from both myopia and hypermetropia . in such situations he requires bi focal lenses two spectacles in one frame . in which the upper half is a concave lens used to correct myopia and the lower half is a convex lens used to correct hypermetropia .
 when light travelling in one medium falls at an angle on another medium . it bends . this phenomenon of bending of light at the surface separating two media is commonly known as refraction of light .
the case of light falling normally or perpendicularly on a glass slab in all our discussions so far we have assumed that the incident ray of light falls obliquely to the surface of glass slab and bending of ray of light takes place . if the incident ray falls normally or perpendicularly to the surface of a glass slab . then there is no bending of the ray of light . and it goes straight . for example . in figure . a ray of light ao travelling in air falls on a glass slab normally or perpendicularly at
magnetic field and magnetic field lines the space around a magnet in which the force of attraction and repulsion due to the magnet can be detected is called the magnetic field .
disadvantages of hydroelectric power a hydroelectric power is generated only near the rivers having water throughout the year . this electric power has to be carried to the sub stations for distribution to the houses and factories situated far off from the sites of hydroelectric power stations . this is done through the transmission wires . so lot of money is to be spent on this process . b a large area of fertile land is submerged at the site of the dam constructed for tapping energy from the flowing water . c a large number of people residing near the site of a dam are dislocated . so . a lot of problems are to be faced in rehabilitating this population . that is why . there is a lot of opposition by the people around the site of dam for the construction of dam . d a large number of plants and wild life in the area of the dam is submerged in water . so . a large variety of flora plants and fauna animals is destroyed . e hydroelectric dams cannot be constructed everywhere . they are constructed mostly in hilly areas .

electric potential when a small positive test charge is placed in the electric field due to another charge . it experiences a force . so . work has to be done on the positive test charge to move it against this force of repulsion . the electric potential or potential at a point in an electric field is defined as the work done in moving a unit positive charge from infinity to that point . potential is denoted by the symbol v and its unit is volt . a potential of volt at a point means that joule of work is done in moving unit positive charge from infinity to that point . since the unit of charge is coulomb . so we can also say that a potential of volt at a point means that joule of work is done in moving coulomb of positive charge from infinity to that point . a more common term used in electricity is . however . potential difference which we will discuss now .
electric current when two charged bodies at different electric potentials are connected by a metal wire . then electric charges will flow from the body at higher potential to the one at lower potential till they both acquire the same potential . this flow of charges in the metal wire constitutes an electric current . it is the potential difference between the ends of the wire which makes the electric charges or current to flow in the wire . we now know that the electric charges whose flow in a metal wire constitutes electric current are the negative charges called electrons . keeping this in mind . we can now define electric current as follows .

the term fossil means the remains of prehistoric plants and animals buried under the earth millions of years ago may be due to some natural calamity . fossil fuels are formed from dead plants and animals which got buried deep in the earth and got covered with sediments like mud and sand in the absence of oxygen . chemical reactions . high pressure . heat and the action of anaerobic bacteria converted these fossils into fossil fuels like coal . petroleum and natural gas .
axis is x y . now . a ray of light ad coming from an object is parallel to the principal axis of the convex lens . it enters the convex lens and gets refracted or bends at point d inside it . after refraction its path changes . it passes through focus f and goes in the direction dx see figure .
competition window electric field electric field may be defined as the space surrounding a charge or a system of charges within which the influence of these charge can be felt . the force per unit charge experienced by a very small test charge at a point in an electric field is called the intensity of the electric field at that point .

ciliary muscles ciliary muscles controls the focal length of the eye lens . when these muscles contracts . the focal length of the lens decreases . on the other hand . when they expand . they exert inward pressure on the eye lens and increases the focal length of the lens .
slip rings r . and r . are two hollow metal rings held at different heights . the end d of the armature coil is connected to ring r . the end c of the coil is passed through ry without touching it and is connected to r . these rings rotate with the rotation of the armature .
magnetic field lines do not cross each other . crowding of magnetic field lines means a strong magnetic field .
the two reflected rays dx and ea are diverging rays but they appear to intersect at point a when produced backwards . thus a is the virtual image of point a of the object . to get the full image of the object . we draw the perpendicular a b to the axis from point a . thus a b is the virtual image of the object ab . it is clear from figure that the image is formed behind the convex mirror between the pole and the focus . it is virtual . erect and smaller than the object or diminished . from the above discussion we conclude that when an object is placed anywhere between pole p and infinity in front of a convex mirror . the image formed is i behind the mirror between pole p and focus f . ii virtual and erect . and iii diminished smaller than the object .

 ii maxwell s cork screw rule or right hand screw rule imagine a right handed screw to be rotated in the direction of current and . then the direction of rotation gives the direction of magnetic field lines . screws are of two types . right handed and left handed . a right handed screw is one which when rotated towards the right hand will close . whereas a left hand screw is one which when rotated towards the left will close . in figure . b . if we rotate a right handed screw in the direction of current downwards . then the screw will rotate in the clockwise direction . thus . the direction of the magnetic field will be clockwise .

magnetic field is inclined at an angle of about with the geographical axis . due to this a freely suspended magnet or magnetic needle makes an angle of about with the geographical axis and points only approximately in the north south directions at a place . in other words . a freely suspended magnet does not show exact geographical north and south because the magnetic axis and geographical axis of the earth do not coincide . it is now believed that the earth s magnetism is due to the magnetic effect of current which is flowing in the liquid core at the centre of the earth . thus . earth is a huge electromagnet . before we go further and discuss the magnetic effect of current in detail . please answer the following questions

the two half rings r . and r . rotate with the coil and touch the two carbon brushes b . and b . one by one . as a result . each carbon brush continues to have the same polarity or . brush b . always remains positive and brush b remains negative . since the current remains in the same direction . therefore . the current so produced is called direct current de .
cause of refraction light rays get deviated from their original path . while entering from one transparent medium to another medium of different density . this deviation change in direction in the path of light is due to the change in velocity of light in the different medium . the velocity of light depends on the nature of the medium in which it travels . velocity of light in a rarer medium low optical density is more than in a denser medium high optical density .
uses telescopes . camera lens . burning glass in a camera . in eye while reading photocopier projector . microscope objective spotlights magnifying glass . eye lenses spectacles for long sightedness .
therefore . glass is optically denser than water . and more bending of light rays takes place in glass than in water . from this we conclude that higher the refractive index of a substance . more it will change the direction of a beam of light passing through it .

myopia short sightedness or near sightedness is corrected by using spectacles containing concave lenses . when a concave lens diverging lens l of suitable power is placed in front of the myopic eye as shown in figure c . then the parallel rays of light coming from the distant object at infinity are first diverged by the concave lens . due to this the concave lens forms a virtual image of the distant object at the far point f of this myopic eye see figure c . since the rays of light now appear to be coming from the eye s far point f . they can be easily focused by the eye lens to form an image on the retina see figure c . please note that the concave lens used for correcting myopia should be of such a focal length or power that it produces a virtual image of the distant object lying at infinity at the far point of the myopic eye .
the two wires coming out of the meter are connected to a main switch s . this main switch is to switch off the electricity supply when required so as to repair any faults in the internal wiring . after the main switch . there is another fuse f in the live wire . this is called consumer s fuse . it is very important to note here that usually there are two separate circuits in a house . the lighting circuit with a a fuse and the power circuit with a a fuse . the lighting circuit is for running low power rating devices such as electric bulbs . tube lights . fans . radio . and tv . etc . . which draw small current . on the other hand . power circuit is for running high power rating devices such as electric iron . room heater . geyser . electric stove . refrigerator . etc . . which draw heavy current . but to make things simple . we will describe only a lighting circuit with a ampere fuse . each distribution circuit is provided with a separate fuse so that if a fault like short circuiting occurs in one circuit . its corresponding fuse blows off but the other circuit remains unaffected . another

 b electric bulb glows when electric current flows through the filament of the bulb . filament of an electric bulb is made of a thin wire of tungsten . the melting point of filament is high i . e . . about c . the filament of the bulb is enclosed in a glass envelope fixed over an insulated support . the glass envelope of electric bulb is filled with inactive gases like nitrogen and argon . since resistance of thin filament is very high . so a large heat is produced as the electric current flows through the filament . due to this large amount of heat produced . filament of the bulb becomes white hot . hence . the filament of the bulb emits light and heat .
 . when the object lies between f and f consider two rays one moving parallel to the principal axis and the other passing through the optical centre . after refraction the two rays meet beyond f on the other side of the lens . thus . the image lies beyond f fig . . when the object lies between f and f . then . the image is formed beyond f . . the image is real . inverted and bigger than object . . it is used in . microscope objective .
far point and near point although the power of accommodation of the eye is amazing . it has certain limitations . the focal length of the eye cannot adjust enough to form sharp images of objects kept beyond a certain point and closer than a certain point . the farthest point up to which the eye can see properly is called the far point of the eye . for the normal eye . the far point is at infinity . when viewing an object at the far point . the ciliary muscles are in their most relaxed state . and the crystalline lens is at its thinnest figure . a . thus . the eye lens is at its maximum focal length when looking at an object at the far point .
dispersion and scattering of light dj you know that when a ray of light passes through a transparent rectangular slab with parallel faces . the emergent ray gets displaced parallel to itself . but a prism causes a net deviation change in direction in the path of a ray of light . in figure . . if the prism were not present . the ray of light would have travelled along a straight line . i . e . . along pt . because of the refractions at the two surfaces of the prism . the ray bends and travels along rs after emerging from the prism . the total angle through which the ray deviates is ztds . this angle is called fig . . cross section of a prism showing passage of a ray the angle of deviation . for a given angle of incidence i . the deviation produced by a prism depends on the refractive index of the prism material . the higher the refractive index . the greater is the deviation .

point of incidence the point on the reflecting surface at which a ray of light strikes . is called the point of incidence as well as point of reflection also .
working when the key is not plugged . no current flows through the circuit and the lamp does not glow . when the key is plugged . the circuit is completed and a current begins to flow through the various components of the circuit . as a result the lamp glows . when the resistance of the circuit is varied with the help of the rheostat . the brightness of the lamp changes . on increasing the resistance one finds that the deflection of the ammeter decreases . this shows a decrease in current and hence a decrease in the intensity of the lamp . when the resistance is decreased the reverse occurs . the change in current due to the variation of resistance can be noted from the ammeter and the potential difference across the bulb can be noted from the voltmeter .

resistances or resistors in parallel the combined resistance or resultant resistance of a number of resistances or resistors connected in parallel can be calculated by using the law of combination of resistances in parallel . according to the law of combination of resistances in parallel the reciprocal of the combined resistance of a number of resistances connected in parallel is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of all the individual resistances . for example . if a number of resistances . r . r . r . . . . . . etc . . are connected in parallel . then their combined resistance r is given by the formula . . . r r r r suppose that a resistance r of ohms and another resistance r of ohms are connected in parallel and we want to find out their combined resistance r . we know that r rr t . . . . . . . now . r so . combined resistance . r ohms

in figure . the object ab has been placed between the focus f and centre of curvature c of a concave mirror . now . a ray of light ad parallel to the principal axis gets reflected at point d and then passes through the focus f . a second ray of light ae passing through the centre of curvature c falls normally on the mirror surface at e and returns along the same path . thus . we have two reflected rays df and ec which are converging in the downward direction . if we extend these rays further in the downward direction . they actually intersect at point a . thus a is the real image of point a of the object . to get the complete image we draw a b perpendicular to the axis from point a . thus . a b is the real image of the object ab and it can be received on a screen . for example . if we take a lighted

atmospheric refraction we know that when light goes from one medium to another medium having different optical densities . then refraction of light rays or bending of light rays takes place . now . in the atmosphere . we have air everywhere . but all the air in the atmosphere is not at the same temperature . some of the air layers of the atmosphere are cold whereas other air layers of the atmosphere are comparatively warm or hotter . now . the cooler air layers of the atmosphere behave as optically denser medium for light rays whereas the warmer air layers or hotter air layers of the atmosphere behave as optically rarer medium for the light rays . so . in the same atmosphere we have air layers having different optical densities . and when light rays pass through the atmosphere having air layers of different optical densities . then refraction of light takes place . the refraction of light caused by the earth s atmosphere having air layers of varying optical densities is called atmospheric refraction .

thus . a metal is a collection of positive ions fixed at their position and a large number of free electrons moving freely in the metal . because there are a very large number of atoms per unit volume in a metal and hence a very large number of free electrons per unit volume are present . these electrons collide with each other and with other ions and change their speed and direction continuously . the electrons follow a zigzag path inside a metal conductor when it is not connected to a battery figure . . note that these free electrons cannot come out of the metal but are free to move anywhere in the metal .

characteristics of light the speed of light in vacuum or free space is x m s . marginally less in air equals to x m s . in water it is . m s and in glass it is m s . the speed of light changes when it travels from one medium to another . light travels from one point to another in a straight line which is known as rectilinear propagation of light . the light gets reflected when it falls on polished surfaces like mirror . the frequency of light remains same in all mediums . the light undergoes refraction when it travels from one transparent medium to another .

 . atmospheric refraction we live at the bottom of an ocean of air called atmosphere . light that reaches us . travels through this atmosphere air and is modified by it . the earth s atmosphere is not uniform . under most conditions the density of the atmosphere decreases with increasing height from the surface . the refractive index depends on the density of a gas because the less dense the gas . the more like a vacuum it becomes . refraction occurs whenever there is any change in the refractive index . when there is an abrupt change as at the surface of glass . the change in the direction of the light is abrupt . but when the change is gradual . the path of a light ray is a gentle curve . the gradual increase in the refractive index as light travels into the lower atmosphere means that light from celestial objects such as the sun . moon . and stars bend towards the normal as it travels from an optically rarer into an optically denser medium . this difference of refractive index amongst the various layers of the atmosphere gives rise to some spectacular phenomenon . some of these phenomena are illustrated below .

conductors and insulators materials that conduct electricity easily are called good conductors or simply . conductors . and . materials that do not conduct electricity easily are called insulators . all metals conduct electricity because they have some loosely bound free electrons . which flow when a potential difference is applied . however . some metals conduct electricity better than others . silver is the best conductor . but because of the high cost of silver . electric wires are made of copper . or in some cases aluminium . most nonmetallic solids do not conduct electricity . although diamond and graphite are both forms of carbon a nonmetal . graphite is a conductor while diamond is an insulator . insulators do not conduct electricity because their electrons are tightly bound to the atoms . rubber . plastics . wood . glass and porcelain are some examples of insulators . insulators have many uses . for example . they are used as protective covers on electric wires and electrician s tools . certain liquids also conduct electricity . while distilled water is an insulator . addition of certain salts . acids or bases allows it to conduct electricity . under normal circumstances . gases do not conduct electricity .

material . the unit of resistivity is ohm metre . the resistivity of a material depends on its temperature . for metals and alloys of metals . the resistivity increases with rise in temperature . the resistivities of some materials are given in table . . note that the values of resistivity of metals are very small of the order of m . this makes them good conductors . metals such as copper are therefore used for making electric wires . the filament of an electric bulb incandescent lamp is usually made of tungsten . as the melting point of tungsten is very high . the values of resistivity of insulators such as glass and fused quartz are very high of the order of m . alloys like nichrome have times larger values of resistivity than those of metals . this makes them suitable for use in the heating elements of electric irons . toasters . etc . these alloys also have an advantage their resistance varies very little with temperature . and these do not oxidize readily .
it is also due to the refraction of light that a thick glass slab appears to be less thick when seen from above . than it actually is . similarly . an ink mark or the writing on a piece of paper appears to be raised and much nearer than it actually is . when viewed by keeping a glass slab over it see figure
when the point object is on the principal axis let us consider a point object o placed on the principal axis of a spherical mirror figure . shows this for both types of spherical mirrors . a ray op along the principal axis falls normally on the mirror and . therefore . retraces its path . take any other ray oa . incident on the mirror at a . let the reflected ray or its projection backwards cut the principal axis at i . as i is the point of intersection of the reflected rays . it is the image of o . all reflected rays will pass through or seem to pass through it . thus . the image of a point on the principal axis is formed on the principal axis itself .

accommodation a normal eye can see the distant objects as well as the nearby objects clearly . we will now discuss how the eye is able to focus the objects lying at various distances . an eye can focus the images of the distant objects as well as the nearby objects on its retina by changing the focal length or converging power of its lens . the focal length of the eye lens is changed by the action of ciliary muscles . the ciliary muscles can change the thickness of the soft and flexible eye lens and hence its focal length which . in turn . changes the converging power of the eye lens . let us see how it happens .

we have now to draw a second ray of light starting from the same point a and passing through the optical centre c . for this we join the points a and c by a line . thus . the line ac represents a ray of light passing through the optical centre c of the lens . now . according to the second rule of image formation . this ray should go straight . so . we extend the line ac further in the direction cy . thus . cy is the second refracted ray . the two refracted rays dx and cy are diverging rays and appear to intersect at point a on the left side of the lens . only when they are produced backwards . so . to an eye placed on the right side of the concave lens as shown in figure . the top of arrow appears to be at a . thus . a is the virtual image of the top point a of the object . to get the complete image of the object . we draw a b perpendicular to the axis from point a . thus . a b is the image of the object ab . the image is virtual . erect and smaller than the object . it is situated between

 . hydro energy water flowing from higher level to lower level has kinetic energy which can be converted into mechanical energy and then to electrical energy . thus . flowing water is a very good source of energy . this energy of water is still utilised in transporting heavy logs of wood from inaccessible forests or hills .
when a ray of light travels from an optically rarer medium to an optically denser medium it bends towards the normal . in this case . the angle of incidence is greater than the angle of refraction . when light travels from an optically denser to an optically rarer medium it bends away from the normal . in this case . the angle of incidence is smaller than the angle of refraction .
 eye light entering the eye is controlled by the size of the pupil . which can be changed with the help of the iris . in dim light . the pupil widens to allow more light to go in . in bright light . it contracts .
if we reverse the direction of electric current flowing in the wire ab by reversing the battery connections . we will find that the compass needle is deflected in the opposite direction . this shows that when we reverse the direction of electric current flowing in the wire . then the direction of magnetic field produced by it is also reversed . a concealed current carrying conductor can be located due to the magnetic effect of current by using a plotting compass . for example . if a plotting compass is moved on a wall . its needle will show deflection at the place where current carrying wire is concealed . magnetic field patterns produced by current carrying conductors having different shapes the pattern of magnetic field or shape of magnetic field lines produced by a current carrying conductor depends on its shape . different magnetic field patterns are produced by current carrying conductors having different shapes . we will now study the magnetic field patterns produced by i a straight conductor or straight wire carrying current . ii a circular loop or circular wire carrying current . and iii a solenoid long coil of wire carrying current . we will discuss all these cases . one by one . let us start with the straight current carrying conductor .

from the above table we find that the resistivity of copper is . x ohm metre . now . by saying that the resistivity of copper is . x ohm metre . we mean that if we take a rod of copper metal metre long and square metre in area of cross section . then its resistance will be . ohms . please note that a good conductor of electricity should have a low resistivity and a poor conductor of electricity will have a high resistivity . from the above table we find that of all the metals . silver has the lowest resistivity of . x m . which means that silver offers the least resistance to the flow of current through it . thus . silver metal is the best conductor of electricity . it is obvious that we should make electric wires of silver metal . but silver is a very costly metal . we use copper and aluminium wires for the transmission of electricity because copper and aluminium have very low resistivities due to which they are very good conductors of electricity . from this discussion we conclude that silver . copper and aluminium are very good conductors of electricity .

. so no force acts on the sides ad and bc of the coil . we have just described the construction and working of a simple electric motor . in commercial motors a the coil is wound on a soft iron core . the soft iron core becomes magnetised and increases the strength of magnetic field . this makes the motor more powerful . the assembly of soft iron core and coil is called an armature . b the coil contains a large number of turns of the insulated copper wire . c a powerful electromagnet is used in place of permanent magnet . all these features together help in increasing the power of commercial electric motors .

since the current is directly proportional to the potential difference applied across the ends of a conductor . it means that if the potential difference across the ends of a conductor is doubled . the current flowing through it also gets doubled . and if the potential difference is halved . the current also gets halved . on
how to distinguish between a convex lens and a concave lens without touching them we keep the lens close to the page of a book and see the image of the writing of the book through it . if the letters of the book appear enlarged . then it is a convex lens and if the letters appear diminished . then it is a concave lens . this is due to the fact that when an object is within the focus of a convex lens . it produces an enlarged image . but a concave lens produces a diminished image for all positions of the object . so . in this case the object the book has been placed within focus of the lens .

wind energy a moving mass of air is called wind . let us see . with the help of an example . what causes wind . during the day . the land near the sea heats up faster than the water of the sea . therefore . the air over the land heats up faster than that over the sea . the warm air over the land rises . and to take its place the colder air from the sea moves towards the land . this moving air is called wind . similarly . winds arise whenever two adjoining areas on the surface of the earth are unequally heated by the sun . like any moving object . wind has kinetic energy . clearly . the ultimate source of this energy is the sun . the invention of the windmill made it possible to do things like grind grain at mills and lift water with the help of wind energy . a windmill is a device in which the energy of the wind is used to rotate a set of blades . and the rational energy of the blades is used to do some work . the blades of a modern windmill make it look like a fan mounted on a tall column . the blades are kept high above the ground to catch the wind .

this allowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through the second prism . he found a beam of white light emerging from the other side of the second prism . this observation gave newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven colours . any light that gives a spectrum similar to that of sunlight is often referred to as white light .

uses of concave mirrors i concave mirrors are used as shaving mirrors to see a large image of the face . this is because when the face is held within the focus of a concave mirror . then an enlarged image of the face is seen in the concave mirror . this helps in making a smooth shave . for the same reason . concave mirrors are used as make up mirrors .

the new cartesian sign convention for lenses is shown in figure . the object is always placed on the left side of the lens as shown in figure . so that the direction of incident light is from left to right . all the distances measured from the optical centre c of the lens to the right side will be considered positive because they will be in the same direction as the incident light . on the other hand . all the distances measured from the optical centre c of the lens to the left side are considered negative because they are measured against the direction of incident light . on the basis of new cartesian sign convention . the focal length of a convex lens is considered positive and written with a plus sign . on the other hand . the focal length of a concave lens is considered negative and written with a minus sign . please note that the sign convention for spherical lenses is very similar to the sign convention for spherical mirrors which we have already studied .

this formula gives us the heat produced in joules when a current of i amperes flows in a wire of resistance r ohms for time t seconds . this is known as joule s law of heating . according to joule s law of heating given by the formula h r x r xt . it is clear that the heat produced in a wire is directly proportional to i square of current ii resistance of wire r iii time t . for which current is passed a since the heat produced is directly proportional to the square of current hoc so . if we double the current . then the heat produced will become four times . and if we halve the current . then heat generated will become one fourth . b since the heat produced in a wire is directly proportional to the resistance ho r so . if we double the resistance . then heat produced will also get doubled . and if we halve the resistance . then the heat produced will also be halved . this means that a given current will produce more heat in a high resistance wire than in a low resistance wire .
which electrical work is done or the rate at which electrical energy is consumed . is called electric power .
kilowatt hour we have seen that power is the rate of energy consumed or produced . if joule of energy is used per second . we say that energy is used at the rate of watt . in other words . if energy is used at the rate of watt . the total energy used in second is joule . how much energy is used in hour if it is used at the rate of watts it is watts seconds . . joules . this amount of energy is called kilowatt hour . written in short as kwh . thus . kwh . . j . x j . the electrical energy used in houses . factories . etc . . is measured in kilowatt hours . the cost of electricity is fixed per kilowatt hour . one kilowatt hour of electrical energy is often called one unit .

of oil has been predicted by survey . when a well is drilled through the rocks . natural gas comes out first with a great pressure and for a time . the crude oil comes out by itself due to gas pressure . after the pressure has subsided . the crude oil is pumped out of the oil well . it should be noted that many wells yield only natural gas but no oil . so . hundreds of wells may have to be drilled into the rocks and tested before getting an oil well from which oil can be produced profitably .
that is part of the answer . yet a rainbow shows that there remains a significant amount of visible light coloured indigo and violet beyond the blue . the rest of the answer to this puzzle is in the way our vision works . we have three types of colour receptors . or cones . in our retina . they are called red . blue and green because they respond most strongly to light at those wavelengths . as they are stimulated in different proportions our visual system constructs the colours we see . when we look up at the sky the red cones respond to the small amount of scattered red light and also less strongly to orange and yellow wavelengths . the green cones respond to yellow and the more strongly scattered green and green blue wavelengths . the blue cones are stimulated by colours near blue wavelengths which are very strongly scattered . if there were no indigo and violet in the spectrum the sky would appear blue with a slight green tinge . however . the most strongly scattered indigo and violet wavelengths stimulate the red cones slightly as well as the blue . which is why these colours appear blue with an added red tinge . the net effect is that the red and green cones are stimulated about equally by the light from the sky while the blue is stimulated more strongly . this combination accounts for the pale sky blue colour .

fossil fuels a natural fuel formed deep under the earth from the pre historic remains of living organisms like plants and animals is called a fossil fuel . coal . petroleum and natural gas are fossil fuels . fossil fuels are dug out from the earth . besides being used directly in homes . transport vehicles and industry . fossil fuels are the major source of energy for generating electricity in power plants . we will first understand how fossil fuels were formed .
characteristics of an ideal fuel or good fuel while choosing the most appropriate fuel for our domestic use or for use in industry . we should keep in mind the following characteristics of an ideal fuel or good fuel . . it should have a high calorific value . in other words . an ideal fuel or good fuel is that which gives us more heat per unit mass . . it should burn without giving out any smoke or harmful gases . that is . an ideal fuel or good fuel is that which does not pollute air on burning by giving out smoke or poisonous gases . . it should have a proper ignition temperature . so that it can be burned easily . the ignition temperature of an ideal fuel or good fuel should neither be too low nor too high . because if the ignition temperature of the fuel is very low . then the fuel will catch fire too easily and hence it will be very unsafe to use it . on the other hand . if the ignition temperature is too high . then it will be very difficult to light the fuel . . it should be cheap and easily available . that is . an ideal fuel or good fuel is that which is not expensive and which is available in plenty everywhere .
types of reflection regular reflection the reflection of a parallel beam of light from a mirror so that the reflected rays are parallel to each other as shown in figure a are called regular reflection . irregular reflection the reflection of light from a rough irregular surface such as walls of a room . page of a book randomly in various directions not parallel to each other as shown in figure b are called irregular reflection . a regular reflection b irregular reflection
 . magnetic field due to a current carrying solenoid a solenoid is a coil of many circular turns of insulated copper wires wrapped closely in the shape of a cylinder such that diameter of the coil is smaller than its length . when a current is passed through a solenoid . a magnetic field is developed in it . as the electric current in each circular coil flows in the same direction . the magnetic field of the loop makes one end of a solenoid act as a north pole and the other end as the south pole .
maximum current to pass through them . if the current passing through wires exceeds this maximum value . the copper wires get over heated and may even cause a fire . an extremely large current can flow in domestic wiring under two circumstances short circuiting and overloading .
 . like poles both north or both south repel each other and unlike poles one north and one south attract each other fig . is an illustration to this fact . when a south and a north pole are brought closer they attract each other . whereas when two north or two south poles are brought closer they repel

is shown in figure b . on end of the solenoid acts as south pole and the other end acts as north pole . if the current flows in a clockwise direction when the coil is seen end on . then that end of the solenoid acts as a south pole . on the other hand . if the current flows in anticlockwise direction when the coil is seen end on . then that end of the solenoid acts as a north pole figure c . thus . face or end b of the solenoid behaves as south pole and face or end a of the solenoid behaves as north pole figure b . in other words . a current carrying solenoid behaves as a bar magnet .

this is most correctly called the tyndall effect but it is more commonly known to physicists as rayleigh scattering . after lord rayleigh who studied it in more detail a few years later . he showed that the amount of light scattered is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength for sufficiently small particles . it follows that blue light is scattered more than red light by a factor of .
then only the position and size of the image changes . there are two main positions of an object in the case of a concave lens from the point of view of position and size of image . the object can be i anywhere between optical centre c and infinity . and ii at infinity . we will discuss both these cases one by one . let us first describe the formation of image by a concave lens when the object is anywhere between optical centre c and infinity .

energy at that rate for about billion years more . since the sun is very . very far away . only a small fraction of the solar energy radiated by the sun reaches the outer layer of the earth s atmosphere . a little less than half about per cent of solar energy which falls on the periphery top surface of the atmosphere actually reaches the surface of earth the rest of solar energy is reflected back into space by the atmosphere and also absorbed by the atmosphere as it comes down through it towards the surface of earth .
conclusion when the object moves away from the convex mirror . the image also moves from the convex mirror towards its focus and simultaneously its size decreases . the image remain virtual and erect throughout .

sin i si please note that since the refractive index is a ratio of two similar quantities the sines of angles . it has no units . it is a pure number . the refractive index of a substance does not depend on the angle of incidence . when we talk of refractive index of a substance . say glass . we mean the value of sin . for light sin i passing from air to glass . strictly speaking . it should mean the value of sin r for light passing from vacuum to glass . but the difference in using air in place of vacuum is so small that it is ignored .
formation of different types of images by a convex lens the type of image formed by a convex lens depends on the position of the object in front of the lens . we can place the object at different positions or distances from a convex lens to get different types of
magnification for a concave mirror can be positive or negative . while that of a convex mirror is always positive .
the resistivity of conductors like metals is very low . the resistivity of most of the metals increases with temperature . on the other hand . the resistivity of insulators like ebonite . glass and diamond is very high and does not change with temperature . the resistivity of semi conductors like silicon and germanium is in between those of conductors and insulators . and decreases on increasing the temperature . semi conductors are proving to be of great practical importance because of their marked change in conducting properties with temperature . impurity . concentration . etc . semi conductors are used for making solar cells and transistors . we will now solve some problems based on resistivity .

an important advantage of using wind energy for generating electricity is that its use mystudygear does not cause any pollution . another advantage is that wind energy is a renewable source do of energy which will never get exhausted . as long as the sun keeps shining . the wind will keep blowing and provide us energy . the increased use of wind energy for generating electricity will help us conserve fossil fuels like coal . petroleum and natural gas so that they may last longer . moreover . wind energy is available free of cost at 
material through which current flows . since . resistance of nichrome is high . so a large amount of heat is produced in the element of the electric heater . thus . filament of electric heater becomes red hot . on the other hand . connecting wires are made of copper or aluminium . since electric resistivity and hence resistance of copper or aluminium is very small . so a very small heat is produced in the connecting wires made of copper or aluminium .

the current in the coil is called an induced current . because the current is brought about or induced by a changing magnetic field . since a source of brought about or induced hy a cha potential difference is always needed to produce a current . the coil itself behaves as if it were a source of potential difference . this potential difference is known as an induced potential difference . thus . a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference in the coil . and the potential difference leads to an induced current .

relation between radius of curvature and focal length of a spherical mirror for a spherical mirror having small aperture . the principal focus f lies exactly mid way between the pole p and centre of curvature c see figures and . so . the focal length of a spherical mirror a concave mirror or a convex mirror is equal to half of its radius of curvature . if f is the focal length of a spherical mirror and r is its radius of curvature . then ef hl let us solve one problem now .
it is also possible that the same person has both the defects of vision myopia as well as hypermetropia . a person suffering from myopia as well as hypermetropia uses spectacles having bifocal lenses in which upper part consists of a concave lens to correct myopia used for distant vision and the lower part consists of a convex lens to correct hypermetropia used for reading purposes see figure . these days it is possible to correct the refractive defects of the eye such as myopia and hypermetropia by using contact
principal focus the point at which a narrow beam of light moving parallel to its principal axis . meets or appears to meet after reflection from the mirror . is called the principal focus of the mirror . it is represented by f .
the near point of an eye having hypermetropia or long sightedness is at point n which is more than centrimetres away see figure b . the diverging rays of light coming from a hypermetropic person s near point can just be focused by his eye on the retina as shown in figure b . this means that if the object placed at the normal near point n cm can be made to appear as if it were placed at this eye s near point n . then the eye will be able to see it clearly . this can be done by putting a convex lens in front of the eye .
limitations of solar energy a it cannot be used at night . b devices based on solar energy do not work well on cloudy days .
 . . colour of sky during sunrise and sunset when the air is clear . then during sunset sunrise the sun and the sky around it will appear yellow because the light from the sun has passed a long distance through air and some of the blue light has been scattered away . if the air is polluted with small particles . natural or otherwise . the sunset will be redder . sunsets over the sea may also be orange due to salt particles in the air . which are effective tyndall scatterers . the sky around the sun is seen reddened as well as the light coming directly from the sun . this is because all light is scattered relatively well through small angles but blue light is then more likely to be scattered twice or more over the greater distances leaving the yellow . red and orange colours fig . .
in diffuse reflection . a parallel beam of incident light is reflected in different directions . in this case . the parallel incident rays do not remain parallel after reflection . they are scattered in different directions see figure . the diffuse reflection is also known as irregular reflection or scattering . the diffuse reflection of light takes place from rough surfaces like that of paper . cardboard . chalk . table . chair . walls and unpolished metal objects . for example . when a parallel beam of light rays falls on the rough surface of a sheet of paper . the light is scattered by making reflected rays in different directions see figure . thus . a sheet of paper produces diffuse reflection of light . no image is formed in diffuse reflection of light . for example . a rough surface like that of paper does not produce an image of the object due to diffuse reflection of light . actually . the light rays falling on the rough surface of paper are scattered in all directions and hence no image is formed .
all the conductors like metals have some electrons which are loosely held by the nuclei of their atoms . these electrons are called free electrons and can move from one atom to another atom throughout the conductor . the presence of free electrons in a substance makes it a conductor of electricity . the electrons present in insulators are strongly held by the nuclei of their atoms . since there are no free electrons in an insulator which can move from one atom to another . an insulator does not allow electric charges or electricity to flow through it .
how long will an energy source last us we cannot depend on the fossil fuels for much longer . such sources that will get depleted some day are said to be exhaustible sources or non renewable sources of energy . renewable energy is available in our natural environment . in the form of some continuing or repetitive currents of energy . or is stored in such large underground reservoirs that the rate of depletion of the reservoir because of extraction of usable energy is practically negligible .

involved in both are the same . the fact that a current carrying conductor experiences a force in a magnetic field is used in the electric motor . and . the fact that a changing magnetic field induces a current in a conductor is used in an electric generator . in an electric motor . electrical energy is converted into mechanical kinetic energy . on the other hand . a generator converts kinetic energy into electrical energy .
devices in series and parallel you must have seen tiny bulbs strung together for decorating buildings during festivals like diwali . and occasions like marriages . etc . these bulbs are connected in series . and the mains voltage is applied to the combination . the potential difference v of the mains gets divided across the bulbs v v v v . . . . so . a small potential difference exists across each bulb . close to that required to make the bulb work . however . the same current flows through all the bulbs . so . if one bulb goes bad . the current through it stops . and this stops the current through the rest of the bulbs as well . to make the chain of lights work . you have to find and replace the defective bulb . this problem does not occur with the lights in your house . that is because in houses . lights . fans . etc . . are connected in parallel . in parallel connection . the same mains voltage gets applied to each device . but the current through each is different . if one of them goes bad . the current in the other branches of the parallel connection does not stop . another advantage of parallel connection is that . unlike series connection . each device can draw a different current . as per its requirement .

semiconductors metals like copper . silver . iron . etc . . are conductors of electricity as they contain a large number of free electrons . rubber . glass . wood . etc . . are insulators as they have almost no free electrons . in between the two . there are materials such as silicon and germanium in which the number of free electrons is much greater than that in insulators and much smaller than that in conductors . such materials are called semiconductors . their resistivity decreases as the temperature increases . also the resistivity can be drastically changed by putting some impurity in the semiconductor . by controlling the amount of impurity and its distribution . very useful electronic devices are formed from semiconductors . such semiconductor devices are used in computers . digital watches . electronic calculators . etc .
rules for obtaining images formed by concave mirrors when an object is placed in front of a concave mirror . an image is formed . the image is formed at that point where at least two reflected rays intersect or appear to intersect . now . to find out the position of an image formed by a concave mirror . we will use only those two rays of light starting from the object whose paths . after reflection from the mirror . are known to us and easy to draw . the following rays of light are usually used to locate the images formed by concave mirrors . we can call them rules for obtaining images in concave mirrors .

which the retina is at a larger distance from the eye lens . this condition also results in the formation of the image of a distant object in front of the retina even though the eye lens may have correct converging power . figure a shows an eye having the defect called myopia or short sightedness . in this case . the parallel rays of light coming from the distant object o at infinity are converged to form an image i in front of the retina due to which the eye cannot see the distant object clearly see figure a the object is at a large distance called infinity from the eye . so it has not been shown in this figure . the image is formed in
do you know the attraction and repulsion of electric charges can be used in experiments to demonstrate the existence of two types of charge . note that it is possible for a charged object to attract an uncharged object that is free to moves but it cannot repel an uncharged object because it is neutral .
 iii after half rotation . when the coil goes beyond vertical position . the side cd of the coil comes on the left side whereas side ab of the coil comes to the right side . and the two commutator half rings automatically change contact from one brush to the other . so . after half rotation of the coil . the commutator half ring y makes contact with brush p whereas the commutator half ring x makes contact with brush q see figure . this reverses the direction of current in the coil . the reversal of direction of current reverses the direction of forces acting on the sides ab and cd of the coil . the side cd of the coil is now on the left side with a

laws of refraction the way a ray of light refracts when it is incident on the surface separating two media depends not only on the refractive indices of the media but also on the angle of incidence . let ab represent a plane surface separating two transparent media medium and medium . let their refractive indices be n . and n . respectively . the two media can medium be any pair such as air and water . or air and glass . suppose a ray of light po travelling in medium is incident on the surface ab at a point o . draw a normal n . on . to the surface at o . on . is in medium and on . is in medium . the angle i medium between the incident ray po and the normal on . is called the angle of incidence . the angle r between the refracted ray oq in . lo and the normal on . is called the angle of refraction . two laws of refraction govern the refraction that takes place at a surface fig . . of separation such as ab . . do brands ooo

in view of these developments . one must regard light as having dual nature . that is . in some cases light acts like a wave and in the others it acts like a particle . classical electromagnetic wave theory provides an adequate explanation of light propagation and effects of interference whereas the photoelectric effect involving the interaction of light with matter is best explained by assuming that light is a particle . thus . we can say that light propagates as a wave and is emitted and absorbed as a particle .

how the eye adjusts for objects at different distances accommodation for clear vision . sharp images of objects have to form on the retina . since the distance of the retina from the eye lens is fixed . the image distance v is fixed . however . we need to see objects that are at different distances from the eye . if you are looking at a cloud . the object distance is large . if you are looking at your finger . the object distance is small . to form clear and sharp images of both at the same distance from the lens . the focal length of the eye lens has to change . as you know . the ciliary muscles can change the focal length of the eye lens . when we are looking at a distant object usually farther than m . the ciliary muscles are in their most relaxed state . then the focal length of the eye lens is such that rays coming from the distant object are focused on the retina . and we see the object clearly figure . a . when we are looking at a nearby object . the ciliary muscles contract to increase the curvature of the crystalline lens . the thickness of this lens increases . which decreases its focal length and therefore . the focal length of the eye lens . the ciliary muscles adjust the focal length in such a manner that a sharp image is formed on the retina figure . b . this process of adjustment of the focal length of the eye lens is called accommodation . accommodation is the process by which the eye changes the focal length of the eye lens such that a sharp image is always formed on the retina .
if the direction of current in a conductor and the direction of magnetic field in which it is placed . are known . then the direction of force acting on the current carrying conductor can be found out by using fleming s left hand rule . this is described below .

 ii ray the straight line path along which the light travels . in a homogeneous medium . is called a ray . it is represented by an arrow head on a straight line the arrow head gives the direction of propagation of light . fig . 
cause of refraction the speed of light is different in different media or substances . for example . the speed of light in air is x m s whereas that in glass is m s . it is clear from these values that the speed of light is more in air but less in glass . in other words . light travels faster in air but slower in glass . the refraction of light is due to the change in the speed of light on going from one medium to another . thus . when light goes from one medium to another . its speed changes . and this change in speed of light causes the refraction of light . the refraction of light on going from air to glass takes place because the speed of light is different in air and glass being more in air and lesser in glass . so . when light enters from air into glass . its speed changes it gets reduced . and this change in speed of light in going from air to glass causes the refraction of light or bending of light . please note that greater the difference in the speeds of light in the two media . greater will be the amount of refraction or bending of light .
as seen from the table silver has minimum resistivity . therefore . silver is the best conductor of electricity . silver is not used because it is costly .
those substances through which electric charges cannot flow . are called insulators . in other words those substances through which electricity cannot flow are called insulators . glass . ebonite . rubber . most plastics . paper . dry wood . cotton . mica . bakelite . porcelain . and dry air . are all insulators because they do not allow electric charges or electricity to flow through them see figure . in the case of charged insulators like glass . ebonite . etc . . the electric charges remain bound to them . and do not move away .

geothermal energy definition energy harnessed from the heat of the earth . is called geothermal energy this energy does not come directly or indirectly from solar energy . explanation we know that the deeper regions of the earth s crust are very hot . the heat melts the rocks . the molten rocks called magma formed in deeper hot regions of earth s core get pushed upward and trapped in certain regions called hot spots due to geological changes . the magma gets collected at some depth below the earth s surface . these places . called hot spots . become source of geothermal energy . procurement underground water in contact with the hot spots turns into steam which gets compressed to very high pressure . thus steam is extracted by linking pipes through holes drilled upto hot spots . the outcoming steam rotates the turbine of an electric generator and produces electrical energy . locations in india there are only few places where geothermal energy can be exploited on commercial lines . one such place is located in madhya pradesh .
you might have experienced that you are unable to see clearly for sometime when you enter from bright sunlight into a room with dim light . after sometime . however . you may be able to see things in the dim lit room . the pupil of an eye acts like a variable aperture whose size can be varied with the help of the iris . when light is very bright . the iris contracts the pupil to allow less light to enter the eye . however . in dim light the iris expands the pupil to allow more light to enter the eye . thus . the pupil opens completely through the relaxation of the iris .
 . when the object lies between f and optical centre consider two rays one moving parallel to the principal axis and the other passing through the optical centre . after refraction the two rays seem to meet on the same side as that of the object . thus . the image lies on the same side as that of the object fig . . when the object lies between the focus f . and the optical centre . then . the image is formed on the same side as that of object . . the image is virtual . erect and magnified . . it is used in magnifying glass and as eye lenses in spectacles for long sightedness .
finding the image by ray tracing numerous rays of light starting from a point object placed before a spherical mirror fall on the mirror and get reflected . the image of the object is formed at the point of intersection of the reflected rays . ray tracing means locating the image geometrically . this is done by drawing some of the rays and finding the point of intersection of the reflected rays .

aperture the circular area that determines the amount of light falling on a mirror or a lens is its aperture . in case of a spherical mirror . the area of the circle made by its boundary is its aperture . sometimes . the aperture of a spherical mirror is expressed in terms of the diameter of its boundary . thus . a mirror of Ñm aperture would mean that the diameter of its boundary is cm . focus and focal length in figure . c . a ray ab . parallel to the principal axis . is incident on a concave mirror . after reflection . the ray cuts the principal axis at a point f . in fact . if the aperture of the mirror is small . all rays incident parallel to the principal axis will cut the principal axis at this same point f after reflection . in other words . such incident rays converge to f . a concave mirror is therefore also called a converging mirror . in figure . d . a ray ab . parallel to the principal axis . is incident on a convex mirror . the ray is reflected along bd . when bd is produced backwards . it intersects the principal axis at f . for a convex mirror of small aperture . all rays incident parallel to the principal axis . when produced backwards after reflection . appear to diverge from this same point f . a convex mirror is therefore also called a diverging mirror . we can now define focus and focal length of a spherical mirror as follows . the point on the principal axis where rays incident parallel to the principal axis converge to or appear to diverge from after reflection is called the focus of the spherical mirror . the distance of the focus from the pole is called the focal length of the spherical mirror . an incident ray passing or appearing to pass through the focus becomes parallel to the principal axis after reflection . you can see this by reversing the direction of the arrows in figure . .
 . image formation by concave and convex lens . . image formed by a concave lens a when object lies at infinity consider two parallel rays incident on a concave lens . after refraction these rays diverge . on producing the rays backwards these rays seem to come from the first focus of the lens . thus . the image is formed at the first focus fig . . when the object is placed at infinity . then . the image is formed at the focus on the same side as that of the object . . the image is diminished to a point . is virtual and erect .
convex mirrors . it is used as a rear view mirror in automobiles . this is due to the reason that a convex mirror provides a wider field of view than a plane or concave mirror . it produces an erect . diminished and virtual image . usually on the rear view mirror it is written objects in this mirror are closer than they appear fig . . it is because a convex mirror does not give the exact distance of the vehicle coming from behind as it produces a diminished image .
 . when the object lies beyond the centre of curvature c consider a ray starting from the top of the object and parallel to the principal axis . this ray after reflection from the mirror passes through the focus . another ray of light starting from the top of the object and passing through the focus becomes parallel to the principal axis after reflection from the mirror . these two reflected rays meet between the centre of curvature and the focus to form the real image of the object fig . . this image is real . inverted and diminished .
if we hold a matchstick as object in front of a convex mirror . a virtual . erect and diminished smaller image of the matchstick is seen on looking into the convex mirror see figure a . we know that the back side of a shining steel spoon which is bulging outwards is a kind of convex mirror . so . if we keep our face in front of the back side of a shining steel spoon we will see a virtual and erect image of the face which is smaller in size as compared to the face see figure b .
floating gas holder type biogas plant the floating gas holder type biogas plant is quite similar to the fixed dome type . only difference is that it has a mobile dome made up of steel which floats over the slurry in the digester . as more and more gas is produced . the steel gas holder rises up . increasing the pressure inside the gas holder . this pushes the spent slurry towards overflow through outlet chamber
 . directive property when a magnet is suspended freely . it always orients itself in the north south direction . if the bar magnet is free to rotate . one end points north . this end is called the north pole or n pole the other end is the south pole or s pole . the north pole of a magnet is usually coloured red or a red dot is placed on its side . actually . the north and south poles of a magnet point towards the south and north magnetic poles of the earth and not towards the earth s geographic poles .
field is from west to east . so we point our forefinger from west to east direction to represent the magnetic field figure a . now . the current is flowing vertically downwards . so we point our centre finger vertically downwards to represent the direction of current . now . let us look at the direction of our thumb . the thumb points in the forward direction towards south . this gives us the direction of force acting on the wire or direction of motion of wire . so . the force acting on the current carrying wire will be in the south direction as shown by the arrow ad in figure b . and the wire will move in the south direction .
repulsion is sure test of magnetism if we want to test whether a metal bar is magnet or not . then bring a magnet near the ends of the metal bar . if one end of the bar is attracted by the magnet and other end is repelled . then metal bar is a magnet . but if both ends of the metal bar are attracted by the same pole of magnet . then the metal bar is not a magnet but is a magnetic material . therefore . repulsion is the sure test of magnetism .
found that if a soft iron rod called core is placed inside a solenoid . then the strength of magnetic field becomes very large because the iron core gets magnetised by induction . this combination of a solenoid and a soft iron core is called an electromagnet . thus . an electromagnet is a magnet consisting of a long coil of insulated copper wire wrapped around a soft iron core that is magnetised only when electric current is passed through the coil . a simple electromagnet is shown in figure . to make an electromagnet all that we have to do is to take a rod ns of soft iron and wind a coil c of insulated copper wire round it . when the two ends of the copper coil are connected to a battery . an electromagnet is formed see figure .

generator . the armature of the generator rotates within two poles of a strong magnet . the rotation of the armature of the generator between two poles of a strong magnet gives rise to electric current or electricity . this electricity is transmitted to the sub stations through a transformer for further distribution to the houses and factories .
in william gilbert extended these experiments to a variety of materials . using the fact that a compass needle orients in preferred directions . he suggested that the earth itself is a large permanent magnet . before the relation of magnetic interactions to moving charges was understood . the interaction of permanent magnets and compass needles were described in terms of magnetic poles . if a bar shaped permanent magnet . or a bar magnet . is free to rotate . one end points north . this end is called the north pole or n pole the other end is the south pole or s pole . either pole of a permanent magnet attracts an object that contains iron but is not itself magnetised . these days . magnets have a variety of applications . they are used in radio and stereo speakers . as magnetic catchers in almirahs and refrigerators to shut them . in video and audio cassette tapes . on the hard discs and floppies of computers . magnets are also used in medical science in magnetic resonance imaging mri scanners .
 b the direction of the force depends on the direction of the magnetic field and is perpendicular to it . c the direction of the force depends on the direction of the current and is perpendicular to it .
we are now in a position to define the focal length of a lens . the focal length of a lens is the distance between optical centre and principal focus of the lens . in figure . the distance cf is the focal length of the convex lens . it should be noted that the distance cf is also equal to the focal length of the lens . the focal length of a lens is denoted by the letter f . the focal length of a lens depends on the refractive index of the glass from which it is made . and the curvature of its two surfaces . higher the refractive index . shorter will be the focal length . similarly . more the curvature . shorter is the focal length .
images formed by lenses consider a point object placed in front of a thin lens of small aperture . light starting from the object travels in all directions . those rays of light that fall on the lens are transmitted through the lens . the transmitted rays may actually intersect at a point . or they may intersect when produced backwards . their point of intersection is the image of the object . if the rays actually intersect . the image formed is real . and if the rays intersect when produced backwards . the image formed is virtual . the image of an extended object can be found by locating the image of each point on it . we can locate the image formed by a lens of a point object by tracing the paths of any two rays and finding their point of intersection . all transmitted rays will either pass through or seem to pass through this point of intersection . for convenience . we choose two rays whose paths are known . first . we choose the ray that is incident parallel to the principal axis . in case of a convex lens . the transmitted ray will pass through the focus . and in case of a concave lens . the transmitted ray s backward projection will pass through the focus . then . we choose the ray that passes through the optical centre of the lens . this ray is transmitted without any deviation . the point of intersection of these two transmitted rays is the image of the point object . while tracing the rays . we do not show the ray bending at each surface of the lens . instead . we show the incident rays getting bent at the central . vertical line of the lens .
to the principal axis . this ray after reflection from the mirror passes through the focus . another ray of light starting from the top of the object and passing through the focus becomes parallel to the principal axis after reflection from the mirror . these two reflected rays meet at a point lying beyond the centre of curvature to form the real image of the object fig . . this image is real . inverted and bigger than the object .
 laws of refraction . the incident ray . the refracted ray and the normal to the refracting surface at the point of incidence are in the same plane . . the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction satisfy the equation sin i na sin r ne . . . . the second law given above is also called snell s law . in the situation shown in figure . . if the first medium is air then ni . let the refractive index of the second medium be denoted by n . equation . can then be written as sin i n . . . . sin r the ratio ng n . is also called the refractive index of medium with respect to medium and is denoted by the symbol n . if v . and v are the speeds of light in medium and medium respectively . na c n c v or . similarly . . thus . .

limitations of ohm s law although ohm s law has been found valid over a large class of materials . there do exists materials and devices used in electric circuits where the proportionality of v and i does not hold . the deviations broadly are one or more of the following types 
it should be noted that in many respects an electromagnet is better than a permanent magnet because it can produce very strong magnetic fields and its strength can be controlled by varying the number of turns in its coil or by changing the current flowing through the coil .
it should be noted that all the appliances which run on electricity do not convert all the electric energy into heat energy . only the electrical heating appliances convert most of the electric energy into heat energy . for example . when electric current is passed through an electric appliance such as a fan . then most of the electric energy is used up in running the fan or turning the fan . only a very small amount of electric energy is converted into heat energy by a fan . due to this . an electric fan becomes slightly warm when run continuously for a long time . on the other hand . when electric current is passed through an en electric current is passed through an electrical heating appliance such as an electric heater . electric kettle . hair dryer . immersion rod or a geyser . then most of the electrical energy

according to fleming s left hand rule hold the forefinger . the centre finger and the thumb of your left hand at right angles to one another . adjust your hand in such a way that the forefinger points in the direction of magnetic field and the centre finger points in the direction of current . then the direction in which thumb points . gives the direction of force acting on the conductor . since the conductor say . a wire moves along the direction in which the force acts on it . we can also say that the direction in which the thumb points gives the direction of motion of the conductor . to memorize fleming s left hand rule we should remember that the forefinger represents the magnetic field both forefinger and field . start with the same letter f . the centre finger represents current both centre and current start with letter c . and the thumb represents force or motion both thumb and motion contain the letter m . we will make the fleming s left hand rule more clear by taking an example .
when the object is at a considerable distance . we say that the object is at infinity . suppose an object ab in the form of an arrow pointing upwards is at a considerable distance from a convex lens . since the object is very far off from the lens . it has not been shown in figure . now . when the object is at infinity . then all the rays from a given point of the object . which are diverging in the beginning . become parallel to one another when they reach the lens after travelling a long distance . so . in figure . we have two rays

advantages of nuclear energy the advantages of nuclear energy are that i it produces a large amount of useful energy from a very small amount of a nuclear fuel like uranium . ii once the nuclear fuel like uranium is loaded into the reactor . the nuclear power plant can go on producing electricity for two to three years at a stretch . there is no need for putting in nuclear fuel again and again . iii it does not produce gases like carbon dioxide which contribute to greenhouse effect or sulphur dioxide which causes acid rain .
disadvantages of nuclear energy a the waste products of nuclear reactions produced at nuclear power plants are radioactive which keep on emitting harmful nuclear radiations for thousands of years . so . it is very difficult to store or dispose off nuclear wastes safely . improper nuclear waste storage or disposal can pollute the environment . b there is the risk of accidents in nuclear reactors especially the old nuclear reactors . such accidents lead to the leakage of radioactive materials which can cause serious damage to the plants . animals including human beings and the environment . c the high cost of installation of nuclear power plants and the limited availability of uranium fuel make the large scale use of nuclear energy prohibitive .

from the above discussion we conclude that light is a form of energy which causes in us the sensation of sight . light travels in straight lines . the fact that a small source of light casts a sharp shadow of an opaque object tells us that light travels in a straight line path . this is because if light could bend easily and go behind the opaque object . then no shadow could be formed . we will now discuss the nature of light .

we know that when two similar resistance wires are connected in series . then their combined resistance gets doubled but when they are connected in parallel then their combined resistance gets halved . so . a given current will produce more heat per unit time if the two resistances are connected in series than when they are connected in parallel . c since the heat produced in a wire is directly proportional to the time for which current flows Î· Î±t so . if the current is passed through a wire for double the time . then the heat produced is doubled . and if the time is halved . the heat produced is also halved . we will now solve some problems based on the heating effect of current . please note that the formula h r x t for calculating the heat produced can be used only if the current i . resistance rand time t are known to us . in some cases . however . they give us the power p and time t only . in that case the heat energy is to be calculated by using the formula e p x t .

pipe . the slurry is left in digester tank for to days . this dung undergoes anaerobic fermentation and forms biogas which collects in the gas holder . as more and more biogas collects in the gas holder the pressure of gas in it increases and it raises the gas holder . since the gas holder cannot rise up beyond a certain point . the increased gas pressure pushes the spent slurry from the digester tank into the overflow tank . this spent slurry is taken off and used as manure . more fresh slurry is added and thus biogas is produced continuously .
 . the pollution of air caused by burning coal in thermal power plants and factories can also be controlled by installing electrostatic precipitators in their chimneys . when an electrostatic precipitator is installed in the chimney . then the unburnt carbon particles and fly ash particles present in smoke keep on depositing on the inner walls of the chimney and do not go into air . the deposit of carbon and fly ash particles can be removed by sweeping the chimney from time to time .

live . neutral and earth wires the electric power lines enter our house through three wires the live wire . the neutral wire and the earth wire . what are these the live wire is at volts . the ground wire is maintained at zero potential by connecting it to a large plate buried in the ground . and the neutral wire is also maintained at almost zero potential . current enters an appliance through the live wire and returns through the neutral wire . an appliance that consumes relatively low power . e . g . . a tube light or a fan . has just two terminals . using them . the appliance is connected across the live and neutral wires . appliances such as heaters . electric irons . refrigerators . etc . . have a third terminal . called the earth terminal . this terminal is connected to the metallic body of the appliance . the earth wire of the electric supply is connected to this terminal . this ensures that the metallic body is always at ground potential v . the earth wire does not normally carry a current . in two terminal devices such as a bulb . it does not matter which terminal is connected to the live wire and which . to the neutral . but in an appliance such as an iron . if the live wire gets connected to the ground terminal . the body will be at v . anybody touching the body would get an electric shock . to prevent incorrect connections . the colour of the insulation of a wire is used to identify the type of wire . by convention . red is for live . black is for neutral and green is for earth . in the plug of a heater or a toaster . you will find wires of these colours connected to the terminals of the pins marked l . n and e . all electrical appliances are connected across the neutral and live wires . the same potential difference is therefore . applied to all of them . and hence . they get connected in parallel to the power source . for each electric appliance and electrical socket connected to household wiring .

 . . dc generator a dc generator also called a dc dynamo converts mechanical energy into electrical energy dc . principle it works on the principle that when a coil rotates in a uniform magnetic field . a current is induced in the coil . the direction of induced current is determined by fleming s right hand rule . construction a dc generator consists of the following components as shown in figure . .
along the same path . the two reflected rays intersect at a . thus . a is the real image of point a of the object . to get the complete image . we draw a b perpendicular to the axis . thus . a b is the complete image of the object ab . it is clear from figure that the image a b is formed between the focus f and centre of curvature c . the image is real and inverted . it is smaller in size than the object ab . so we call it a diminished image . from the above discussion we conclude that when an object is placed beyond the centre of curvature c of a concave mirror . the image formed is i between the focus and centre of curvature . ii real and inverted . and iii smaller than the object or diminished .
appear to diverge after passing through the concave lens . in figure . the parallel rays of light appear to be diverging from point f after refraction . so . f is the principal focus of the concave lens for the light rays coming from the left side . like a convex lens . a concave lens also has two foci . one on each side of the concave lens . for example . if the parallel rays fall on the concave lens from the right side . then they will appear to diverge from a point f . thus . f is the second focus of the concave lens . a concave lens is also
figure shows a pool of water or a tank of water . let us take any point o at the bottom of this pool . this point is under the surface of water . our eye sees this point by the light rays coming from it . now . a ray of light oa coming from the point o is travelling in water and it comes out into the air at point a . it gets refracted away from the normal in the direction ax see figure . similarly . another ray of light ob . coming from the point o gets refracted at point b and goes away from the normal in the direction by . the
the electric motor a motor is a device which converts electrical energy into mechanical energy . every motor has a shaft or spindle which rotates continuously when current is passed into it . the rotation of its shaft is used to
in the fissioning of uranium . some mass of uranium disappears is lost . and a tremendous amount of energy is produced . an idea of the tremendous amount of energy produced during nuclear fission reaction can be had from the fact that the fission of atom of uranium produces million times more energy than the energy produced by the burning of atom of carbon from coal . the energy produced during nuclear fission reactions is used for generating electricity at nuclear power plants . please note that the energy produced in a fission reaction is due to the conversion of mass into energy .
fusion is the process of combining two nuclei to form a heavy nucleus . but nuclei have positive charges and thus repel each other . however . if they can be brought close enough together within m . the attractive force comes into play . which can pull the nuclei together and fusion will occur . in order for the nuclei to get close enough together . they must have very high kinetic energy . this high energy can be imparted by raising the temperature to a very high degree of the order of k a temperature usually found in the core of the stars . this temperature is very difficult to obtain . however . this can be triggered by atomic explosions involving nuclear fission . once the fusion reaction begins . the energy liberated can maintain the minimum required temperature and the fusion continues . at this stage the fusion of hydrogen gets out of control and leads to an explosion of what is called a hydrogen bomb .
 . electric potential and potential difference when two bodies at different temperatures are brought in contact with each other . heat flows from the body at a higher temperature . to the body at lower temperature . the more the temperature difference . more is the flow of heat . similarly . water also flows from a higher pressure to the lower pressure . as shown in figure . . the pump builds up and maintains pressure to push water from the reservoir to the top . from the top . the water falls down under the effect of gravity . for flow of charges in a conducting metallic wire gravity . of course . has no role to play the electrons move only if there is a difference of electric pressure called the potential difference along the conductor . this difference in potential is produced by a cell or battery . in a cell . chemical reactions produce potential difference between the two terminals of the cell . as a result . the positive charge flows from higher potential to lower potential and the negative charge flows from lower potential to higher potential .
effects of refraction of light the refraction of light produces many effects which can be easily observed in our day to day life . we will now describe some of the important effects of the refraction of light . it is due to the refraction of light that i a stick or pencil held obliquely and partly immersed in water appears to be bent at the water surface . ii an object placed under water appears to be raised . iii a pool of water appears to be less deep than it actually is . iv when a thick glass slab is placed over some printed matter . the letters appear raised when viewed from the top . v a lemon kept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bigger than its actual size . when viewed from the sides . vi the stars appear to twinkle on a clear night . all these effects are produced by the refraction of light or change in direction of light when it passes from one medium to another . let us discuss some of these effects of refraction in detail .
when a short circuit takes place . or when overloading takes place . the current becomes large and heats the fuse wire too much . since the melting point of fuse wire is much lower than copper wires . the fuse wire melts and breaks the circuit as shown in figure b . when the fuse wire breaks . electricity supply is automatically switched off before any damage can be done to the rest of the wiring or the electrical appliances being used .

 . . diverging or concave lens figure . shows a diverging lens or a concave lens . the beam of parallel rays incident on this lens diverges after refraction . the focal length of a concave lens is negative and the lens is also called a negative lens . the focal points of a negative lens are reversed . relative to those of a positive lens . the second focal point f . of a negative lens is the point from which rays that are originally parallel to the axis diverge after refraction . a concave lens is thicker at the edges and thinner at the centre .
since a magnetic needle can be deflected only due to the presence of a magnetic field . therefore . oersted concluded that a magnetic field is produced around the current carrying wire .
all the solar heating devices are designed in such a way that they help in collecting as much sun s heat rays as possible . this is done by using a black painted surface . a glass sheet cover . and in some cases also a plane mirror reflector . a black painted surface is used because black surface absorbs more heat rays of the sun than a white surface . a glass sheet is used as a cover in solar heating devices because a glass sheet traps more and more of sun s heat rays by producing greenhouse effect . a plane mirror reflector is used in solar cooker to increase the area over which solar energy is collected so that more heat rays of the sun may enter the solar cooker box . keeping these points in mind we will now describe the construction and working of a solar cooker in detail .

magnetic field the most striking thing about magnets is the attraction and repulsion between them . how do we explain these forces between two magnets we say that a magnet produces a magnetic field in the space around it . which exerts a force on any other magnet placed in it . each point in this field has a particular strength . the field at each point also has a definite direction . the direction of the magnetic field due to a magnet at a point near it can be found by placing a magnetic compass at that point . the compass needle comes to rest along a particular direction . the direction of the magnetic field at the point is the direction from the south pole to the north pole of the needle . when a magnetic compass is kept at a place which is away from all magnets . its needle comes to rest along the north south direction . this means that the direction of the magnetic field there is from the south to the north . this field is produced by the earth . the magnetic field of the earth also affects a compass needle placed near a magnet . the direction of the compass needle gives the direction of the net magnetic field due to the bar magnet and the earth . however . if the compass is close to the magnet . the contribution due to the earth s field may be neglected . to find out how the direction of the magnetic field changes at different places near a magnet . do the following activities .
when the above two expressions are combined . then the expression obtained for the magnetic field around a straight current carrying conductor is kl b where i is the current through the conductor and r is the distance of the point of observation from the straight conductor . here . k is a constant about which you will learn in higher classes . the current i is measured in ampere a and the distance r is measured in metre m .
it is obvious from the circuit given in figure that all the electrical appliances are provided with separate switches . it should be noted that all the switches are put in the live wire . so that when we switch off an electrical appliance like an electric iron . then its connection with the live wire is cut off and there will be no danger of an electric shock if we touch the metal case of the electrical appliance . if . however . we put switches in the neutral wire . then the live wire will be in connection with the electrical appliance even when the switch is in the off position . and there is a danger of an electric shock .
 . when the object lies at the centre of curvature c consider a ray starting from the top of the object and parallel to the principal axis . this ray after reflection from the mirror passes through the focus . another ray of light starting from the top of the object and passing through the focus becomes parallel to the principal axis after reflection from the mirror . these two reflected

the lines of force in a magnetic field are those imaginary lines which continuously represent the direction of the magnetic field . the tangent drawn at any point on a line of force shows the direction of magnetic field at that point .
electromagnetic induction using two coils so far we have learnt that electromagnetic induction can be brought about by moving a straight wire between the poles of a u shaped magnet or by moving a bar magnet in a circular coil of wire . we will now study that electromagnetic induction can also be produced by using two coils . this is because if current is changed in one coil . then current is induced in the other coil kept near it . no relative motion of the coils is needed in this case . this will become more clear from the following discussion . two circular coils a and b are placed side by side . close to each other see figure . coil a is connected to a battery and a switch s whereas coil b is connected to a galvanometer g .
direction of electric field . the potential continually decreases along the path . now if another path is considered from the uncharged conductor to infinity . the potential again continually decreases . obviously . the uncharged conductor is at intermediate potential between the charged conductor and infinity .
light is a form of electromagnetic wave which excites in us the sensation of sight .
 . when the object is at infinity consider two rays coming from infinity . where the object is placed . these rays . after reflection from the mirror . seem to come from the focus . this is the image of the distant object fig . . this image formed is virtual . erect and extremely diminished .
current . the magnetic field and the force . are at right angles to one another . it should be noted that the maximum force is exerted on a current carrying conductor only when it is perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field . no force acts on a current carrying conductor when it is parallel to the magnetic field . if we reverse the direction of current in the wire ab so that it flows in the vertically upward direction from b to a . then the wire swings in the backward direction towards north . this means that the direction
refractive index light travels the fastest in vacuum with the highest speed of x m s . in air . the speed of light is only marginally less . compared to that in vacuum . but for all practical purposes . we consider the speed of light in air equal to the speed of light in vacuum . however speed of light decreases in denser media like water . glass etc . it means when light goes from air to some other medium like water and glass . its speed decreases . the amount of change in the speed of light in a medium depends upon the property of the medium . this property is known as refractive index of the medium . refractive index is a measure of how much the speed of light changes when it enters a medium from air .
finding the image of extended objects the image of an extended object formed by a spherical mirror can be found by locating the images of the individual points of the object . one case of interest is that of a small . linear object placed on the principal axis . perpendicular to it . we can find the whole image by just locating the images of the points at the top and bottom of the object .
harnessing energy tidal energy can be harnessed by constructing a tidal barrage or tidal dam . this barrage traps the water risen during the high tide . the trapped water is then allowed to fall down slowly on turbines water wheels to start them rotating . the rotating turbines generate electricity .

images formed by a concave mirror table . shows the formation of image by a concave mirror in several situations . you should carefully study each ray diagram and verify its entries in the table . in case a . the object ab is at infinity . and the rays coming from b are parallel to the principal axis . they meet at the focus . where a real . point sized image is formed . in actual practice . we may be interested in looking at an object that is at a very large but finite distance . in that case . a very small . inverted image is formed . close to the focus . case b is the same as that shown in figure . a . and the ray diagram has already been explained . in case c . the ray bd passes through the focus f after reflection . the ray bf becomes parallel to the principal axis after reflection . the reflected rays meet at b . the image a b is inverted . has the same size as the object and is formed at the same distance from the mirror . in case d . the reflected rays intersect beyond c and an enlarged magnified . inverted image is formed .
when an object is placed in front of a plane mirror . then the right side of object appears to become the left side of image and the left side of object appears to become the right side of image . this change of sides of an object and its mirror image is called lateral inversion . the phenomenon of lateral

 . attractive property a magnet can attract small pieces of magnetic substances like iron . steel . cobalt . alnico etc . the attraction is a maximum at the two ends called the poles . it is minimum or zero at the centre of the magnet . if some iron filings are sprinkled near a bar magnet they orient themselves as shown in figure . .
colour of the sun at sunrise and sunset at the time of sunrise and sunset . the position of the sun is very far away from us . the sunlight travels longer distance through the atmosphere of the earth before reaching our eyes . scattering of blue light is more than the scattering of red light . as a result of this . more red light reaches our eyes than any other colour . therefore at sunset and sunrise sun appears red .
displacement is directly proportional to i angle of incidence ii thickness of glass slab . and iii refractive index of glass slab . higher the values of these factors . greater will be the lateral displacement . another point to be noted is that in this case the refraction or bending of light takes place twice first at point o when light enters from air into glass . and then at point b when light goes out from glass into air . the angle which the emergent ray makes with the normal
a suspension of small particles in a medium is called a colloid . milk is a colloid in which small fat particles are suspended in water . smoke is a colloid in which ash particles are suspended in air . fog and mist are colloids in which droplets of water are suspended in air . you will be able to see the path of a strong beam of fig . . scattering makes the beams of headlights visible in fog . light through all of these . the scattering of light by the particles in a colloidal solution is called the tyndall effect . the scattered light makes the path of light visible . the activity above is also an example of the tyndall effect .
 . ammeter it is an instrument used to measure the current in a circuit . it is always connected in series in a circuit . it has a positive terminal . through which current enters . and a negative terminal . through which current leaves . fig . . the resistance of an ideal ammeter is zero . . galvanometer it is an instrument used to detect weak currents in a circuit . it is joined in series in a circuit . it does not have a positive or a negative terminal . it can also detect the direction of current in a circuit . . ground this symbol is used when the circuit is connected to the earth . . key open it is an arrangement of making or breaking a circuit . when the key is not plugged the circuit is an open circuit . . key closed when the key is plugged the circuit becomes a closed circuit .
danger signals are of red colour when light falls on the signal . all colours are scattered much more than that of red colour . so the red colour suffering least scattering remains confined around the signal . which in turn illuminates the signal significantly . thus . the danger signals can be seen from very far off distances . moreover . among all colours . red colour or red light is scattered least by smoke or fog . hence red signals are visible even through the smoke or fog .
it is worth noting that as we move away from the straight current carrying conductor the distance between the magnetic field lines increases continuously . this shows that as we move away from the conductor the magnetic field decreases continuously fig . . thus . the concentric circles become larger and larger as we move away from the current carrying conductor .

 . the tremendous amount of energy released during fission is due to mass defect . the sum of the mass of fragments produced and neutrons released during fission is less than the sum of the mass of target u nucleus and bombarding neutrons . for example . the loss in mass during fission can be derived as u on ba kr n in amu . . . . . . . . . thus . mass defect . am . . . amu . amu . mev ae am . from einstein equation . ae amc . x . mev thus . for the fission of each nucleus of uranium . about mev energy is released . it is also evident that about . . amu out of amu of the total mass undergoes decay and produces energy . note that most of the energy is released out in the form of kinetic energy . the pressure and temperature increases tremendously during fission .
this refractive index is called the absolute refractive index . the refractive index is a dimensionless number greater than one since v is always less than c . furthermore n is equal to unity or one for vacuum .
types of electric charges it has been found by experiments that there are two types of electric charges positive charges and negative charges . by convention . the charge acquired by a glass rod rubbed with a silk cloth is called positive charge and the charge acquired by an ebonite rod rubbed with a woollen cloth is called negative charge . an important property of electric charges is that 
the first prism is known as dispersing prism as dispersion takes place at the first face of prism a and second prism b recombines the dispersed colours therefore it is known as recombination prism . both the prism a and b together act as a glass slab with parallel sides . and emergent ray is parallel to the incident ray .
 . . colour of the sky the molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size comparable to the wavelength of visible light . these are . therefore . more effective in scattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer wavelengths at the red end . thus . when sunlight passes through the atmosphere . the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour shorter wavelengths more strongly than red . the scattered blue light enters our eyes . if the earth had no atmosphere . there would not have been any scattering and the sky would appear to be dark as it appears on the moon . since red colour is scattered less . therefore . danger signals are of red colour .

deep coal mines under the surface of earth . coal is important because it can be used as a source of energy as such . or it can be converted into other forms of energy like coal gas . electricity and oil synthetic petrol . the exploitation of coal as a source of energy made the industrial revolution possible . when coal is burnt . the carbon present in coal reacts with the oxygen of air to form carbon dioxide . a lot of heat is produced during the burning of coal which makes it a good fuel . the burning of coal . however . produces a lot of smoke which pollutes the air . when coal is subjected to destructive distillation by heating strongly in the absence of air . then all the volatile material is removed from coal and coke is formed . coke is carbon . coke is a better fuel than coal because it produces more heat than an equal mass of coal . and it does not produce smoke while burning . thus . burning of coke does not cause air pollution .

unit of power we have calculated the power by dividing work done by time taken . now . the unit of work is joule and that of time is second . so . the unit of power is joules per second . this unit of power is called watt . thus . the si unit of electric power is watt which is denoted by the letter w . the power of watt is a rate of working of joule per second . that is . joule watt second
scattering of light scattering of light means to throw light in various random directions . light is scattered when it falls on various types of suspended particles in its path . depending on the size of particles . the scattering can be of white sunlight as such or of the coloured lights which make up the white sunlight . as we will study after a while . the blue colour of the sky and the red colour of the sun at sunrise and at sunset can be explained on the basis of scattering of light caused by the earth s atmosphere or air see figure . we will first describe the tyndall effect .
magnetic field due to currents in coils and solenoids the direction of the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a current carrying circular coil or a loop a can be found from the following rule . if the fingers of the right hand are curled along the direction of the current in a loop . the stretched thumb gives the direction of the magnetic field . at other points . the direction may be different . the magnetic field inside a current carrying solenoid is nearly uniform and is parallel to the axis . the field outside the solenoid is similar to that produced by a bar magnet . if you hold the solenoid in your right hand . with fingers curled along the current . the thumb gives the direction of the field within it . as well as the direction in which the north pole of the solenoid appears .
 . . parallel combination of resistors a number of resistors are said to be connected in parallel if . there is more than one path for current to flow between two points . . one end of each resistor is connected to one common point and the other end to some other common point . . the potential difference across each resistor is same . consider three resistors r . r and rz connected in parallel as shown in figure . b . when the current i reaches point a . it splits into three parts i going through ry . i . going through r and iz going through rz . the current will tend to take the path of least resistance .
a transparent material bounded by two surfaces of which at least one is curved is called a lens . most lenses used in spectacles . magnifying glasses . cameras and microscopes have at least one spherical surface . in some cases . cylindrical lenses are used in spectacles . in this chapter we will study spherical lenses . the cross sections of some lenses are shown in figure . . a lens that is thicker at the middle than at the edges is called a convex lens . while a lens that is thicker at the edges is called a concave lens . if someone in your family uses spectacles . find out by feeling the lenses whether they are
fuse wire will melt if the current exceeds amperes value . the fuse used in the power circuit of a small house for running electric iron . immersion heater . geyser and toaster . etc . . having power of watts or more is of a capacity . a blown fuse should be replaced only after the cause of excessive current flow has been found and removed . these days more and more houses are using miniature circuit breakers mcbs to protect the household wiring from the excessive flow of electric current through it see figure . if the current becomes too large . the miniature circuit breaker puts off a switch cutting off the electric supply . the mcb can be re set when the fault has been corrected . miniature circuit beaker mcb contains an electromagnet which . when the current exceeds the rated value of circuit breaker . becomes strong enough to separate a pair of contacts by putting off a switch and breaks the circuit . so . unlike fuses . mcbs do not work on heating effect of current . mcbs work on the magnetic effect of current .

magnification the size of an image formed by a plane mirror is the same as that of the object . this is not always the case with spherical mirrors . a convex mirror forms an image that is smaller than the object . you might have noticed this in the rear view mirrors of vehicles . the size of the image formed by a concave mirror can be smaller than . equal to or larger than the size of the object . depending on where the object is placed in front of the mirror . let h . and he denote the object height and the image height respectively . the ratio is called magnification . and it is denoted by m . it turns out that m he v h . u m thus . m r . . . . su note that m can be either positive or negative . depending on the nature of the image . if m is positive . h . and he have the same sign . this means that the image is formed on the same side of the principal axis as the object . in other words . the image is erect . if m is negative . the image is inverted

scattering of light normally . when you switch on a torch . you do not see a beam of light travelling from the torch . similarly . during the day you do not see the path of the sunlight as it illuminates things around you . however . you can see the path of light if there is dust . smoke or other small particles in the air . you might have seen the path of sunlight streaming into a room through a gap in the curtains . you might have also seen it coming down through gaps in trees in the early morning mist . in both cases . the path of the light is visible from different positions . you know that light travels in straight lines . so . for us to see the path of light from different positions . light must be redirected in different directions by the particles in its path . the phenomenon in which a part of the light incident on a particle is redirected in different directions is called scattering of light . when light falls on small particles . a part of it gets scattered in different directions . the rest of the light goes straight through . do the following activity to see for yourself .
 . . tidal energy periodic rise and fall of ocean water level occurring twice in each lunar day are called ocean tides . high tides occur on every new moon day and full moon day that can raise the level of water by a few metres . tides occur due to gravitational forces of the moon and the sun on ocean water . the difference in the levels of ocean water between high tide and low tide results in the ocean tidal energy . a tidal dam or a barrier is constructed and the ocean water during the high tide is trapped by the barrier fig . . this water is then allowed to fall down on water turbine . thereby converting kinetic energy of flowing water into mechanical energy and then to electrical energy .

the alternating current a . c . produced in india has a frequency of hz . that is . the coil is rotated at the rate of revolutions per second . since in revolution of coil . the current reverses its direction times . so in revolutions of coil . the current reverses its direction x times . thus . the a . c . supply in india reverses its direction times in second . another way of saying this is that the alternating current produced in india reverses its direction every second . that is . each terminal of the coil is positive for of a second and negative for the next of a second . this process is repeated again and again with the result that there is actually no positive and negative in an a . c . generator .
biogas is obtained by anaerobic fermentation of animal waste like . animal dung . and plant wastes in the presence of water . the fermentation is carried out by anaerobic bacteria in the presence of water but in the absence of oxygen . the anaerobic bacteria decompose the carbon compounds present in the animal and plant wastes in the form of carbohydrates . proteins and fats into methane gas . some of these bacteria breakdown biomass to sugars . organic acids and other compounds . these are further decomposed by other bacteria to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen . finally . these combine to form methane and water . the scheme of reaction is as under co h ch ho biogas is prepared in biogas plants which use all types of waste biomass like animal dung . sewage . crop residues . vegetable wastes . water hyacinth . poultry droppings . and wastes from agro based industries etc . the two most common biogas plants are i fixed dome type biogas plant ii floating gas holder type biogas plant

please note that the image formed by a plane mirror can be seen only by looking into the mirror . so . if a screen is placed at position i . no image would be formed on it because the light rays do not actually pass through the point i . they only appear to do so . an image of this type . which cannot be received on a screen . is known as a virtual image . another point to be noted is that the light rays shown by dotted lines behind the mirror are only imaginary light rays . there can be no real light rays behind a mirror because it has a silvered reflecting surface at its back covered with a paint which does not allow light rays to pass
it is used as eye lens in galileo telescope .
plotting compass . the magnetic field lines leave the north pole of a magnet and enter its south pole as shown in figure . in other words . each magnetic field line is directed from the north pole of a magnet to its south pole . each field line indicates . at every point on it . the direction of magnetic force that would act on a north pole if it were placed at that point . the strength of magnetic field is indicated by the degree of closeness of the field lines . where the field lines are closest together . the magnetic field is the strongest . for example . the field lines are closest together at the two poles of the bar magnet . so the magnetic field is the strongest at the poles . please note that no two magnetic field lines are found to cross each other . if two field lines crossed each other . it would mean that at the point of intersection . the compass needle would point in two directions at the same time . which is not possible . it should be noted that we have drawn the magnetic lines

lens and get refracted or bent according to the laws of refraction . all the rays . after passing through the convex lens . converge at the same point f on the other side right side of the lens . the point f is called principal focus or just focus of the convex lens . we can now say that the principal focus of a convex lens is a point on its principal axis to which light rays parallel to the principal axis converge after passing through the lens . in figure . point f is the principal focus for the light rays coming from the left side . if the incident light rays fall on the convex lens from the right hand side . they will converge to a point f on the left side of the lens . thus . f is the second focus of the convex lens . from this discussion we conclude that a te lens has two foci . the two foci of a lens are at equal
from point a . thus . a b is the complete image of object ab . when our eye looks into the lens from the right side . it appears as if the light rays are coming from a and b instead of a and b . thus . a b is the virtual image . it is erect . larger than the object and can be seen only by looking through the lens . it is formed on the same side of the lens as the object . from the above discussion we conclude that when the object is placed within the focus of a convex lens . the image formed is i behind the object on the left side of lens . ii virtual and erect . and iii larger than the object enlarged or magnified .
box type solar cooker a solar cooker is a device that uses solar energy for cooking . in its simplest form it consists of a special box in which the food to be cooked is placed . the box is made of an insulating material such as plastic or wood . the box may be double walled . with an insulating material even air between the outer and inner walls . this reduces heat loss due to conduction more effectively . the inner walls are painted black to increase heat absorption . the box is covered with a glass sheet . this reduces heat loss by radiation and traps heat . which increases the temperature inside the box . the covered box is made airtight to reduce heat loss by convection . to increase the amount of sunlight going into the box . a plane mirror is hinged at an angle at the top of the box .

magnetism in human beings extremely weak electric currents are produced in the human body by the movement of charged particles called ions . these are called ionic currents . now . we have studied that whenever there is an electric current . a magnetic field is produced . so . when the weak ionic currents flow along the nerve cells . they produce magnetic field in our body . for example . when we try to touch something with our hand . our nerves carry electric impulse to the appropriate muscles . and this electric impulse creates a temporary magnetism in the body . the magnetism produced in the human body is very . very weak as compared to the earth s magnetism . the two main organs of the human body where the magnetic field produced is quite significant are the heart and the brain .

thus . if we join two resistances of ohms and ohms in series . then their combined resistance or resultant resistance will be ohms which is equal to the sum of the individual resistances . before we derive the formula for the resultant resistance of a number of resistances connected in series . we should keep in mind that i when a number of resistances connected in series are joined to the terminals of a battery . then each resistance has a different potential difference across its ends which depends on the value of resistance . but the total potential difference across the ends of all the resistances in series is equal to the voltage of the battery . thus . when a number of resistances are connected in series . then the sum of the potential differences across all the resistances is equal to the voltage of the battery applied ii when a number of resistances are connected in series . then the same current flows through each resistance which is equal to the current flowing in the whole circuit .
the image is virtual . erect same side up as the object . because both the object and image have arrow head at the top . and of the same size as the object . please note that in figure . the image a b has been drawn by dotted line just to show that it is a virtual image . thus . the nature of image formed by a plane mirror is virtual and erect . and the size of image formed by a plane mirror is equal to that of the object . the image is at the same distance behind the plane mirror as the object arrow is in front of the mirror .

a fusion process is just the opposite of fission process . the energy produced in nuclear fusion reaction is . however . much more than that produced in a nuclear fission reaction . the energy produced during nuclear fusion has not been controlled so far . so . nuclear fusion energy could not be used for generating electricity so far . please note that the nuclear reactions which occur at extremely high temperatures are called thermonuclear reactions . before we describe a hydrogen bomb . please note that the hydrogen isotope of mass number is called tritium .
wind energy moving air is called wind . wind has energy . the energy possessed by wind is due to its high speed or motion . so . the wind possesses kinetic energy . it is this kinetic energy of wind which is utilised for doing work . solar energy or sun s energy is responsible for the blowing of wind . wind blows due to the uneven heating of earth by the sun in different regions . so . wind energy comes from the sun in an indirect way .
before we describe the wiring of our rooms . it is very important to note here that alongwith the live wire and the neutral wire . a third wire called earth wire also goes into our rooms . in figure . the earth wire e has been shown by dotted line . one end of the earth wire e is connected to a copper plate and buried deep under the earth near the house as shown in figure or at the nearest electric sub station . the earth connection is first made to the electric meter and then to the main switch . this earth wire then goes into our room alongwith the live wire and the neutral wire . please note that the earth wire up to the main switch of our house is usually an uncovered . thick copper wire having no plastic insulation over it . but the earth wire which goes from the main switch into our rooms is a copper wire having green insulation covering over it . thus . in order to distinguish between the live wire . neutral wire and earth wire . the wire having red plastic covering is made live wire . the wire having black plastic covering is made neutral wire . and the wire having green plastic covering is made earth wire .

activity let us trace the path of a ray of light through a transparent glass slab . fix a sheet of white paper on a board . place the slab at its middle figure . . draw the boundary of the slab . and then draw a line rp to meet one of the longer boundaries at p . at an angle . fix two pins a . b vertically on this line about cm apart . look at the image of the pins from the other side of the slab . now fix a pin c such that it appears to be in a straight line with the images of a and b . fix another pin d at least cm from c such that all four pins appear to be in a straight line . remove the pins and join by a straight line the points where the pins c and d were inserted . extend this line to meet the boundary of the slab at q . join pq . the lines rp . pq and qd represent the directions of the incident ray . the refracted ray within the slab and the emergent ray after the second refraction respectively . you will find that the qd is parallel to rp . also . it is shifted sideways from the direction of rp . note that the incident ray bent towards the normal at p . as it moved from the optically rarer medium air to the optically denser medium glass . at q . the ray going from the optically denser medium glass to the optically rarer medium air . bent away from the normal at q .
this also makes the light from the star to increase or decrease in intensity . since the stars are very distant . they approximate point sized sources of light . this makes the star sometimes to appear brighter and sometimes dimmer . the light coming from the stars . therefore . presents a quivering shaking appearance . thus giving the impression as if the stars are twinkling .
 ii medium a substance through which light propagates or tends to propagate is called a medium . it is of following three kinds a transparent it is a medium through which light can be propagated easily . e . g . . glass . water . etc . b translucent it is a medium through which light is propagated partially . e . g . . paper . ground . glass . etc . c opaque it is a medium through which light cannot be propagated . e . g . . wood . iron . etc .

the potential difference to be applied between the terminals of the device is also mentioned . the standard voltage pd for home appliances is v under the british system which we follow here in india . in the usa . it is v . but quite often we have low voltage due to shortage of electrical energy . a bulb marked
an electric appliance consumes the specified power w only if it runs at the specified voltage . if the applied voltage is greater than the specified voltage of the appliance . the appliance will get damaged . similarly . if the appliance is made to run at a lower voltage its power consumption decreases .
incident ray the ray of light which strikes the reflecting surface at the point of incidence is called the incident ray .
is converted into light . so . filament type electric bulbs are not power efficient . on the other hand . tube lights are much more power efficient . because they have no filaments .
geothermal energy . brought to the surface by natural geysers . is also utilised for generating electricity .
compared to coal and nuclear plants the average geothermal plant requires very little land . while coal and nuclear plants need huge acreage to supply their fuel . an entire geothermal field uses only between one and eight acres per megawatt compared to five to ten acres mw for nuclear and nineteen acres mw for coal .

air air e know that light travels in a straight line path . this is true as long as light rays are travelling in the same medium or same substance having the same density throughout . if . however . the light rays are made to go from one medium to another . the light ray of rays change their direction or bend at the boundary between the two media . light for example . when a ray of light travelling in air goes obliquely into another sa medium glass . it changes the direction or bends on entering the glass block see figure . the change in direction of ray of light or bending of ray of glass light occurs again when it goes out from glass into air see figure . the block change in direction of light when it passes from one medium to another obliquely . is called refraction of light . in other words . the bending of light when it goes from one medium to another obliquely is called refraction of light . the refraction of light takes place when light rays enter from air into figure . the ray of light changes glass or from glass into air . the refraction of light takes place when light enters direction or refracts at point a from air into water or from water into air . and the refraction of light also when it goes from air into glass . takes place when light enters from water into glass or from glass into water . the ray of light changes direction the optical instruments like camera . microscope . and telescope work on the orreir a microscope and telescope work on the or refracts again at point b when refraction of light through glass lenses . we will now understand the refraction it goes from glass into air . of light more clearly with the help of a diagram .

please note that no matter where the object is placed in front of a concave lens . the concave lens always forms a virtual . erect and diminished image of the object . when the distance of an object from a concave lens is changed .
the underground water in contact with the hot spots turns into steam . since this steam is trapped between rocks . it gets compressed to high pressure . this steam is extracted by sinking pipes through holes drilled up to hot spots . the steam comes up at high pressure . which can be utilised to turn the turbine of electric generator . in some places . the steam and hot water from hot spots may come to the surface without drilling holes . this happens if water could find its way through large cracks between rocks . hot water and steam gushes out with very high pressure from the surface that forms natural geysers . geothermal energy . brought to the surface by natural geysers . is also utilised for generating electricity . geothermal plants need several wells . drilling these wells does have an impact on the land but processes like advanced directional or slant drilling lessens that impact . many wells can be drilled from one pad . which minimises the amount of land needed for things like fluid piping and
the two reflected rays ax and by are diverging moving away from one another . so they cannot meet on the left side . let us produce the reflected rays ax and by backwards as shown by dotted lines in figure . they meet at point i behind the mirror . now . when the reflected rays ax and by enter the eye of a person at position e . the eye sees the rays of light in
 another term that we will be using is the normal . the normal is a line at right angle to the mirror surface at the point of incidence . in other words . normal is a line which is perpendicular to the mirror at the point of incidence . in figure . the mirror is mm and the point of incidence is o . so . the line on is the normal to the mirror surface at point o . the normal has been represented by a dotted line to distinguish it from the incident ray and the reflected ray . please note that normal is just a perpendicular line to the mirror . and it should not be called the normal ray like the incident ray or reflected ray . the normal is a line at right angles to the mirror surface . in other words . normal makes an angle of with the surface of the plane mirror . we will now discuss the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection .
there are a number of ways a magnetic field can be used to generate an electric current figure . illustrates one of them . this figure shows a bar magnet and a helical coil of wire to which a galvanometer is connected . when there is no relative motion between the bar magnet and the coil . as in part a of the figure . the galvanometer reads zero . indicating there is no current . however . when the magnet moves toward the coil . as in part b a current appears in the coil . as the magnet approaches . the magnetic field that it creates at the location of the coil becomes stronger and stronger . and it is this changing magnetic field that produces the current . when the magnet moves away from the coil . as in part c . a current also exists . but the direction of the current is reversed . now . the magnetic field at the coil becomes weaker as the magnet moves away . once again . it is the changing magnetic field at the coil that generates the current .
what is a good source of energy whenever work has to be done . energy is needed . this energy is supplied by a source of energy . different sources of energy are used depending on the type of work to be done . some sources of energy may be good whereas others may not be so good . we can find out whether a given source of energy is good or not by making use of the following characteristics or qualities of a good source of energy . a good source of energy is one i which would do a large amount of work per unit mass or per unit volume . ii which is cheap and easily available . iii which is easy to store and transport .
magnetic poles always exist in pairs the pole of a magnet cannot be separated . if a bar magnet is cut into two pieces each piece will behaves as a complete magnet having a north and a south pole .
 ii after the armature has turned through . it occupies the position shown in figure b . with the armature rotating in the same direction i . e . . anticlockwise . bc moves inwards and ad moves outwards . thus . again applying fleming s right hand rule . we find the induced current in the external circuit r and g flows in the opposite direction due to which the direction of deflection in the galvanometer is towards left . thus . we see that the direction of induced current changes in external circuit after every half revolution of the armature . i . e . . after the armature has turned through an angle of from its initial position . hence . the induced current is alternating in nature . magnitude of induced emf in a generator can be increased by a increasing the number of turns of its armature . b increasing area of the armature c increasing speed of rotation of the armature and d increasing the strength of the magnetic field .
distances from the optical centre . one on either side of the lens the word foci is the plural form of focus . the two foci of a lens are usually denoted by the letters f and f . since all the light rays actually pass through the focus of a convex lens . therefore . a convex lens has real focus .

 iii the length of air gap between its poles . if we reduce the length of air gap between the poles of an electromagnet . then its strength increases . for example . the air gap between the poles of a straight . bar type electromagnet is quite large . so a bar type electromagnet is not very strong . on the other hand . the air gap between the poles of a u shaped electromagnet is small . so it is a very strong electromagnet see figure .
you might have noted that the sun looks oval at sunrise and sunset . as you can see from the figure . the rays from the lower regions of the sun travel a greater distance through the atmosphere than those from the upper regions . so . they bend more . as a result . the image of the lower region gets shifted upwards more than that of the upper region . this makes the sun appear like a flattened circle . or an oval .

if we move the wire ab up and down continuously between the poles of the horse shoe magnet . then a continuous electric current will be produced in the wire . but the direction of this electric current will change rapidly as the direction of movement of the wire changes . this is because when the wire moves up . then the current in it will flow in one direction but when the wire moves down . then the current in it will flow in opposite direction . we will see the pointer of galvanometer move to and fro rapidly as the current in the wire changes direction of flow continuously . the electric current produced in the wire which changes direction continuously is called alternating current or a . c .
on pressing the switch . a current flows in the wire ab in the vertically downward direction . the wire ab is kicked in the forward direction towards south and its lower end b reaches the position b . so that the wire comes to the new position ab as shown by dotted line in figure . when the lower end b of the hanging wire comes forward to b . its contact with the mercury surface is broken due to which the circuit breaks and current stops flowing in the wire ab . since no current flows in the wire . no force acts on the wire in this position and it falls back to its original position . as soon as the wire falls back . its lower end again touches the mercury surface . current starts flowing in the wire and it is kicked
you know that light travels at . . m s in vacuum . this speed is often taken approximately as . . m s . i . e . . . km s . the speed of light in a transparent medium such as glass . water or clear plastic is less than this . the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in a medium is called the refractive index of the medium . this ratio is denoted by n or u . thus . refractive index n . . . . here . c the speed of light in vacuum and v the speed of light in the medium . in all material media the speed of light is less than c . hence . the refractive index of a material medium is greater than see table . . the speed of light in air at atmospheric pressure is very close to that in vacuum . and we generally take the refractive index of air as the actual value is about . . the refractive index of water is about . . and that of ordinary glass and diamond are about . and . respectively . larger the refractive index of a medium . greater is the bending of light when it enters the medium from air obliquely . thus light bends more when it enters a diamond than when it enters an imitation jewel made of glass . table . refractive indices . water kerosene benzene crown glass carbon disulphide flint glass diamond . . . . . .

in order to calculate the power of a lens . we need its focal length in metres . in many problems . the focal length of a lens is usually given to us in centimetres . so . to calculate the power of such a lens . we should first convert the focal length of the lens into metres by dividing the given centimetre value by . if . however . the focal length is already in metres . then there is no need to change it . we will now solve some problems based on the calculation of power of lenses .
if we extend the refracted rays ax and by backwards to the left side . then a virtual image of the coin is formed at point i . nearer to the surface of water see figure b . the refracted rays ax and by . which appear to be coming from the virtual image of the coin can enter our eye at position e due to which the coin becomes visible to us . thus . when the coin is under water then due to refraction of light . a virtual image of the coin is formed nearer to the water surface . and since the virtual image of coin which we see . is nearer to the water surface . so the coin appears to rise on adding water in the basin . thus . it is due to the refraction of light that a coin placed at the bottom of a container appears to rise as the container is slowly filled with water .
according to the above classification . wood obtained by the cutting of trees is a renewable source of energy . now . a newly planted sapling usually takes more than years to grow and mature into a tree . so . replenishment of cut down trees takes a very long time . another disadvantage is that the cutting down of trees on a large scale for obtaining wood causes depletion of the forests leading to an imbalance on of the forests leading to an imbalance in nature . due to these reasons . using wood as a source of energy is not a wise decision even though it is a renewable source of energy .

an important discussion a normal eye can see the distant objects as well as the nearby objects clearly due to its power of accommodation . before we discuss the power of accommodation of the eye . we should know the difference between the distant objects and nearby objects from the point of view of light rays received from them . this is described below .
construction of the eye the front part of the eye is called cornea . it is made of a transparent substance and it is bulging outwards . the outer surface of cornea is convex in shape . the light coming from objects enters the eye through cornea . just behind the cornea is the iris or coloured diaphragm . iris is a flat . coloured . ring shaped membrane behind the cornea of the eye . there is a hole in the middle of the iris which is called pupil of the eye . thus . pupil is a hole in the middle of the iris . the pupil appears black because no light is reflected from it .

smooth surface like that of a plane mirror produces a clear image of an object due to regular reflection of light . a highly polished metal surface and a still water surface also produce regular reflection of light and form images . this is why we can see our face in a polished metal object as well as in the still water surface of a pond or lake . a polished wooden table is very smooth and hence produces regular reflection of light .

the resistance of a conductor is given by the expression . r . where p is called the resistivity of the material of which the conductor is made . when a wire of resistance r is drawn to n times the original length . then its resistance becomes nr .
lateral inversion if we stand in front of a big plane mirror . we see the image of our body in it . though our image appears to be just as we are . but there is a difference . this is because if we lift our right hand . then our image lifts its left hand . and if we lift our left hand . then the image appears to lift its right hand see figure . this means that the right side of our body becomes left side in the image whereas the left side of our body becomes right side in the image . it appears as if our image has been reversed sideways with respect to our body . this effect of reversing the sides of an object and its image is called lateral inversion . and we say that the image formed in a plane mirror is laterally inverted . in other words . the image formed in a plane mirror is sideways reversed with respect to the object . we can now define lateral inversion as follows

sign convention for spherical mirrors these days new cartesian sign convention is used for measuring the various distances in the ray diagrams of spherical mirrors concave mirrors and convex mirrors . according to the new cartesian sign convention i all the distances are measured from pole of the mirror as origin . ii distances measured in the same direction as that of incident light are taken as positive .
renewable and nonrenewable sources of energy we have vast but fixed reserves of coal . natural gas and petroleum . these were formed by natural processes over millions of years . however . the rate at which we have been using these sources . their reserves will not last very long . unfortunately . we cannot regenerate them . on the other hand . the sun will continue to shine for about another . billion years . so . as long as there is life on earth . we can use solar energy . sources of energy can be called renewable or nonrenewable based on their reserves as well as our ability to generate them . renewable sources of energy are those which can be generated by us or which are constantly being generated by natural processes or whose supply is unlimited . nonrenewable sources of energy are those which were produced in the past by natural processes . whose supply is limited and which we cannot generate ourselves . coal . natural gas and petroleum are nonrenewable sources of energy . wood is a renewable source of energy although its supply is limited . but . if we replant and use trees in a planned manner . we can be assured of a continuous supply of firewood . the sun . wind and flowing water are also renewable sources because of their unlimited availability . unlike fuels like coal . nuclear fuels such as uranium are required in very small quantities to generate electricity . so . their reserves will last for a long . long time . they are therefore classified as renewable sources of energy .

this defect can be corrected by using a concave lens of suitable focal length . so . a man suffering from this defect wears spectacles having concave lens of suitable focal length . the concave lens diverges the rays of light entering the eye from infinity . hence this lens makes the rays of light appear come from the far point o of the defective eye as shown in figure c .
some objects themselves produce the light that we see . like the sun . a flame . or a light bulb . such objects are called luminous objects . most objects . though . reflect into our eye light that originates elsewhere . and if it were not for reflection . we would not be able to see them . such objects are called non luminous object . our moon is an example of a non luminous object . as it reflects the light of the sun .

 . direction of electric current today . it is known that electrons flow in metal wires . figure . shows the electrons emerging from the negative terminal of the battery and moving around the circuit toward the positive terminal . however . electrons were not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first observed . so . electric current was considered to be the flow of positive charges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the direction of electric current . therefore . as a custom instead . a so called conventional current is used . for reasons that date back to the time when it was believed that positive charges moved through metal wires . conventional current is the hypothetical flow of positive charges that would have the same effect in the circuit as the movement of electrons that actually does occur .
since the direction of induced current in the coil is reversed after half revolution so the polarity positive and negative of the two ends of the coil also changes after half revolution . the end of coil which was positive in the first half of revolution becomes negative in the second half . and the end which was negative in the first half revolution becomes positive in the second half of revolution . thus . in revolution of the coil . the current reverses its direction times . in this way alternating current is produced in this generator .

graph between v and i if a graph is drawn between the potential difference readings v and the corresponding current values . the graph is found to be a straight line passing through the origin see figure . a straight line graph can be obtained only if the two quantities are directly proportional to one another . since the current potential difference graph is a straight line . we conclude that current is directly proportional to the potential difference . it is clear from the graph oa that as the potential difference v increases . the current i also increases . but the ratio remains constant . this constant is called resistance of the conductor . we will now solve one problem based on the graph between v and i .
if we open the switch as shown in figure b . then a gap is created between the two ends of the connecting wire . due to this . one terminal of the cell gets disconnected from the bulb and current stops flowing in the circuit . thus . when the switch is open . the circuit breaks and no current flows through the bulb . the bulb stops glowing see figure b .

the suspended particles of milk scatter more of the bluish lights . this makes the mixture look bluish near the torch . as light travels down the container . the components of light left are mainly reddish in colour . so . the light looks orange or red . a similar thing happens in nature to make skies blue and the sun red when it rises or sets .
advantages of nuclear energy a it produces a large amount of useful energy from a very small amount of a nuclear fuel like uranium . b once the nuclear fuel like uranium is loaded into the reactor . the nuclear power plant can go on producing electricity for two to three years at a stretch . there is no need for putting in nuclear fuel again and again . c it does not produce gases like carbon dioxide which contributes to greenhouse effect or sulphur dioxide which causes acid rain .

the linear magnification produced by a lens is equal to the ratio of image distance to the object distance . that is image distance magnification object distance or m where m magnification v image distance and u object distance it should be noted that this second magnification formula for lenses differs only in sign from the magnification formula for mirrors . the magnification formula for the mirrors is . m whereas that for lenses is . m . it is clear that the magnification formula for mirrors has a minus sign but the magnification formula for lenses has no minus sign . if the magnification m has a positive value . the image is virtual and erect . and if the magnification m has a negative value . the image will be real and inverted . since a convex lens can form virtual images as well as real images . therefore . the magnification produced by a convex lens can be either positive or negative . a concave lens . however . forms only virtual images . so the magnification produced by a concave lens is always positive . a convex lens can form images which are smaller than the object . equal to the object or bigger than the object . therefore . the magnification m produced by a convex lens can be less than . equal to or more than . on the other hand . a concave lens forms images which are always smaller than the object . so the magnification m produced by a concave lens is always less than .

we can understand this fact in the following manner . oersted found that a current carrying conductor produces a magnetic field around itself . when this current carrying conductor is placed in the magnetic field of a magnet . then the magnetic fields of the conductor and the magnet interact . this interaction leads to a force . this force is experienced by both the magnet and the current carrying conductor . in accordance with newton s third law of motion .
introduction the greeks knew the phenomenon of magnetism . as early as around bc . they discovered that certain stones . now called magnetite fe . attract pieces of iron . the chinese called it the lodestone i . e . . the leading stone . legend ascribes the name magnetite to the shepherd magnes . the nails of whose shoes and the tip of whose staff stuck fast in a magnetic field while he pastured his flocks . in pierre de maricourt . using a spherical natural magnet . mapped out the directions taken by a needle when placed at various points on the surface of the sphere . he found that . the directions formed lines that encircle the sphere passing through two points . diametrically opposite to each other . which he called the poles of the magnet . subsequent experiments showed that every magnet . regardless of its shape . has two poles . called north and south poles . which exhibit forces on each other in a manner analogous to electrical charges . that is . like poles repel each other and unlike poles attract each other .
the actual sunrise takes place when the sun is just above the horizon . but due to refraction of sunlight caused by the atmosphere . we can see the rising sun about minutes before it is actually above the horizon . this happens as follows when the sun is slightly below the horizon . then the sun s light coming from less dense air to more dense air is refracted downwards as it passes through the atmosphere . because of this atmospheric refraction . the sun appears to be raised above the horizon when actually it is slightly below the horizon . for example . in figure . the actual position of the sun is at a just below the horizon but it

when this reflected light enters our eyes . then we are able to see the flower or chair because to our eyes . this light appears to be coming from the flower or chair see figure . those objects which do not emit light themselves but only reflect or scatter the light which falls on them . are called non luminous objects see figure . a flower . chair . table . book . trees . other plants . human beings . fan . bed . mirror . diamond . walls . floor . and road . etc . . are all non luminous objects . in fact . most of the objects around us are non luminous objects . we can see the non luminous objects because they reflect light received from a luminous object into our eyes . even the moon is a non luminous object because it does not have its own light . we can see the moon because it reflects the sunlight falling on its surface towards us on the earth .
the straight line direction in which the reflected rays enter it . so . the person looking into the mirror from position e sees the reflected rays as if they are coming from the point i behind the mirror because i is the point of intersection of the reflected rays when produced backwards to the right side . thus . point i is the image of the object o formed by the plane mirror . for example . if our face is at position o in front of the plane mirror . then we will see the image of our face in the mirror at point i .

we will now discuss why the sun appears white when it is overhead in the sky . when the sun is overhead as at noon . then the light coming from the sun has to travel a relatively shorter distance through the atmosphere to reach us . during this shorter journey of sunlight . only a little of the blue colour of the white light is scattered most of the blue light remains in it . since the light coming from the overhead sun has almost all its component colours in the right proportion . therefore . the sun in the sky overhead appears white to us see figure .
 i bar magnet bar magnet is an artificial magnet which may be rectangular or cylindrical in shape .
electromagnetic induction oersted s experiment shows that a current produces a magnetic field . should the reverse is not true is a magnet used to produce current michael faraday began to work on this problem in . for six years . he experimented with magnets and coils of wire until one day in desperation he threw the magnet down into the coil and observed that a momentary current was produced in the coil . this is how a very important discovery was made on th october . after six years of hard labour .
this can be written as medium in medium speed of light in medium speed of light in medium or in v where in refractive index of medium with respect to medium v speed of light in medium and v speed of light in medium please note that the symbol medium nmedium or n means that it is the refractive index of medium with respect to medium for the light entering from medium into medium . we have represented the refractive index of medium with respect to medium by the symbol Ã®n . in some books . however . the refractive index of medium with respect to medium is represented by the symbol n read as n two one and not as n twenty one . we have not used this notation because we find it a bit confusing .
the solenoid it is a coil which has length and used to produce uniform magnetic field of long range .
we should use a convex lens of short focal length as a magnifying glass . it will produce large magnification and hence the object will appear much bigger when seen through it . for example . a convex lens of cm focal length will have a greater magnifying power than a convex lens of cm focal length . so . we should use the convex lens having a shorter focal length of cm as the magnifying glass . thus . if we are given two convex lenses of focal lengths cm and cm respectively . then we should prefer to use the convex lens having cm focal length as a magnifying glass to see small things or read small letters of a dictionary .
rule . a ray of light which is incident at the pole of a concave mirror is reflected back making the same angle with the principal axis . this is shown in figure . here a ray of light ap is incident at the pole p of the concave mirror making an angle of incidence i with the principal axis . it gets reflected along the direction ph such that the angle of reflection r is equal to the angle of incidence i .
concentration of co in atmosphere increases significantly this could have the effect of increasing the average temperature of the earth . . combustion of coal . gasoline and other fossil fuels in the presence of insufficient supply of oxygen liberates carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons . carbon monoxide co combines with haemoglobin in the blood to form carboxy haemoglobin and makes it incapable of transporting oxygen . many hydrocarbons are carcinogenic and hence . are serious health hazards . . coal contains some compounds of sulphur and nitrogen . during combustion these compounds are oxidized to form the oxides of sulphur and nitrogen . which are corrosive and poisonous . during rains these oxides dissolve in rainwater and are known to cause acid rain . . when gasoline burns in internal combustion engines . a very high temperature is produced . at this high temperature . nitrogen and oxygen combine to form oxides of nitrogen such as no and no . these oxides are highly poisonous and cause many respiratory problems . moreover . gasoline also contains some additives such as a tetraethyl lead ch pb . tetraethyl lead is added to gasoline to reduce knocking irregular combustion . during combustion it produces volatile lead compounds which are released in the air . these compounds are highly poisonous and cause serious pollution .

pid . is experienced in old age and therefore . also called old age hypermetropia . cause of presbyopia this defect arises due to the ageing of a person . the ciliary muscles are weakened and the flexibility of the crystalline lens of the human eye decreases with age of the person . as a result . human eye is unable to focus on close objects .
the word generator is a misnomer a word which does not justify its meaning . a generator does not generate anything . it simply converts mechanical energy into electrical energy .
another similar prism . for this he made a small hole in the white screen and obtained the spectrum from the first prism on it . he adjusted the screen in such a way that only a limited portion of spectrum a single colour say yellow colour passes through the hole . this is then made to fall on the similar prism b which is placed in an inverted position with respect to the screen .
 v principal focus f it is a point on the principal axis at which the rays parallel to the principal axis meet after reflection or seem to come from . in figure . . f is the principal focus . the parallel rays after reflection from a concave mirror meet in front of the mirror at point f . this is the focus of the concave mirror . in case of a convex mirror after reflection the parallel rays seems to come from a point f behind the mirror . this is the focus of the convex mirror . therefore . for a concave mirror the focus lies in front of the mirror and for a convex mirror it lies behind the mirror . in other words . a concave mirror has a real focus while a convex mirror has a virtual focus .
why the sun appears red at sunrise and sunset the sun and the surrounding sky appear red at sunrise and at sunset because at that time most of the blue colour present in sunlight has been scattered out and away from our line of sight . leaving behind mainly red colour in the direct sunlight beam that reaches our eyes . this can be explained as follows .
 if we look at the above nuclear fission reaction equation . we find that the neutrons are used up as well as produced . for example . in the nuclear fission of uranium described above . neutron is consumed and neutrons are produced in the fission of each nucleus . the neutrons produced in a fission process cause further fission of the heavy nuclei leading to a self sustaining chain reaction . when all the neutrons produced during fission of uranium are allowed to cause further fission . then so much energy is produced in a very short time that it cannot be controlled and leads to an explosion called atom bomb . we can . however . control a nuclear fission reaction by using control rods made of boron . boron has a property that it can absorb neutrons . so . when a nuclear fission reaction is carried out in the presence of boron rods . the excess neutrons produced during successive fissions of uranium atoms are absorbed by boron rods and hence not available to cause further fission . due to this a controlled fission reaction of uranium takes place liberating heat energy at a slow . steady and manageable rate which can be used for generating electricity at a nuclear power plant .

d . c . generator we have just studied an a . c . generator which produces alternating current . in order to obtain direct current which flows in one direction only . a d . c . generator is used . actually . if we replace the slip rings of an a . c . generator by a commutator . then it will become a d . c . generator . thus . in a d . c . generator . a split ring type commutator is used like the one used in an electric motor . when the two half rings of commutator are connected to the two ends of the generator coil . then one carbon brush is at all times in contact with the coil arm moving down in the magnetic field while the other carbon brush always remains in contact with the coil arm moving up in the magnetic field . due to this . the current in outer circuit always flows in one direction . so . it is direct current . a diagram of d . c . generator is given in figure .
a temperature difference of about c upto a water level difference of m is required for operating otec systems .
it shows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the direction of current and the direction of the magnetic field . experiments have shown that the displacement of the rod is largest or the magnitude of the force is the highest when the direction of current is at right angles to the direction of the magnetic field . in such a situation the force experienced by the current carrying conductor is perpendicular to both the direction of current and the direction of the magnetic field .

 . solar heating devices a solar heating device is one application of solar energy which is enjoying most success today . a device which gets heated by sun s heat is called a solar heating device . a solar heating device must be designed in such a way so that it is capable of collecting and concentrating the maximum amount of sun s heat when it is exposed to sunlight . this is done by using one of the following methods . use of a reflector use of black painted surface use of glass sheet cover
 . magnetic field pattern due to a circular loop or circular wire carrying current we know that when current is passed through a straight wire . it has been found that the magnetic effect of current increases if instead of using a straight wire . the wire is converted into a circular loop as shown in figure . in figure . a circular loop or circular wire is fixed to a thin cardboard sheet t . when a current is passed through the circular loop of wire . a magnetic field is produced around it . the pattern of magnetic field due to a current carrying circular loop or circular wire is shown in figure . the magnetic field lines are circular near the current carrying loop . as we move away . the concentric circles representing magnetic field lines become bigger and bigger . at the centre of the circular loop . the magnetic field lines are straight see point m in figure . by applying right hand thumb rule . it can be seen that each segment of circular loop carrying current produces magnetic field lines in the same direction within the loop . at the centre of the circular loop . all the magnetic field lines are in the same direction and aid each other . due to which the strength of magnetic field increases .

minimum wind velocity required for a functional windmill is about km h .
lenses differ from mirrors . however . in that light can pass through a lens from left to right or from right to left . therefore . when constructing ray diagrams . begin by locating a focal point f on each side of the lens each point lies on the principal axis at the same distance f from the lens . the lens is assumed to be a thin lens . in that its thickness is small compared with the focal length and the distances of the object and the image from the lens . for convenience . it is also assumed that the object is located to the left of the lens and is placed perpendicular to the principal axis . there are three paraxial rays that leave a point on the top of the object and are especially helpful in drawing ray diagrams . when tracing their paths . we follow the reasoning strategy outlined below 
atmospheric refraction atmospheric refraction is responsible for a number of optical phenomena such as the twinkling of stars and the appearance of a heavenly body higher than its actual position .
or actually . watt is a small unit . therefore . a bigger unit of electric power called kilowatt is used for commercial purposes . it is obvious that kilowatt watts kw w it should be noted that the symbol for watt is w and that for kilowatt is kw . when work is done . an equal amount of energy is consumed . so . we can also say that electric power is the rate at which electrical energy is consumed . in other words . electric power is the electrical energy consumed per second . we can now write down another definition of watt based on electrical energy . when an electrical appliance consumes electrical energy at the rate of joule per second . its power is said to be watt . we have just given two definitions of electric power . one by using the term work and another by using the term energy . we can combine these two definitions and say that the rate at

 iii concave mirrors are used as reflectors in torches . vehicle head lights and search lights to get powerful beams of light . this is because when a lighted bulb is placed at the focus of a concave reflector . then the concave reflector produces a powerful beam of parallel light rays . this helps us see things up to a considerable distance in the darkness of night . concave reflectors are also used in room heaters . the concave reflectors of room heaters direct heat rays into the whole room .

please note that when the object kept at infinity in front of a concave mirror is assumed to be a big arrow pointing upwards . then its image is formed at focus according to the ray diagram shown in figure . if . however . the object kept at infinity in front of a concave mirror is round in shape like the sun . then its image is formed at the focus according to the ray diagram shown in figure on page .
 magnetic field a magnet produces a magnetic field in the space around it . which exerts a force on any other magnet placed in it . each point in this field has a particular strength and direction . the direction of the magnetic field can be found by placing a magnetic compass at that point . the needle of the compass settles along the direction of the field .
the solar cell is covered with a glass cover or a transparent plastic cover for protection . when sunlight falls on the surface of solar cell . it makes the loosely held electrons in the silicon atoms move due to which a current begins to flow in the wires connected to the top and bottom of the solar cell . the strength of current produced depends on the brightness of the light and the efficiency of solar cell . a potential difference or voltage of about . v is generated between the top and bottom surface of a solar cell . at present . the best designed solar cells can generate w mÂ² in bright sunlight . with a maximum efficiency of about .
 . fleming s right hand rule from the experiment explained above . we find that the induced current changes its direction with the motion of the magnet in opposite direction . the induced current is found to be the highest when the direction of motion of the coil is at right angles to the magnetic field . in this situation . we can use simple rule called fleming s right hand rule or the dynamo rule to find the direction of induced current .
working let the coil abcd . initially in the horizontal position . be rotated clockwise i . e . . the arm cd moves downwards and arm ab upwards . due to the motion of the coil in the magnetic field . induced current is produced in the coil from c to d according to fleming s right hand rule . this makes brush b . positive and brush b . negative . after half rotation . the arms of the coil interchange their positions . arm ab comes to the right and arm cd to the left . during the second half of the rotation . current flows from b to a in the arm ab .

optical centre and principal axis of a lens the centre point of a lens is known as its optical centre . the optical centre of a lens is usually denoted by the letter c . in figure . c is the optical centre of the convex lens . the optical centre of a lens has a property that a ray of light passing through it does not suffer any deviation and goes straight . the optical centre of a lens is sometimes also denoted by the letter o . the principal axis of a lens is a line passing through the optical centre of the lens and perpendicular
ad and ac coming from the same point a of the object . the incident rays ad and ac are parallel to one another but at an angle to the principal axis . the incident ray ad gets refracted along dx . the second ray ac passing through the optical centre c of the lens goes straight along cy and meets the first refracted ray at a . thus . a is the real image of the top point a of the object . we draw a b perpendicular to the axis from a . thus . a b is the complete image of the object ab placed at infinity . it is clear from figure . that the image is formed at the focus of the lens . it is real . inverted and much smaller than the object . from this discussion we conclude that when an object is at infinity from a convex lens . then the image formed is i at the focus . ii real and inverted . and iii much smaller than the object or highly diminished .

 . types of energy sources and their characteristics the energy sources available can be divided into two types 
the maximum accommodation of a normal eye is reached when the object is at a distance of about cm from the eye . after this the ciliary muscles cannot make the eye lens more thick or more convex . so . an object placed at a distance of less than cm cannot be seen clearly by a normal eye because all the power of accommodation of the eye has already been exhausted . thus . a normal eye has a power of accommodation which enables objects as far as infinity and as close as cm to be focused on the retina . the power of accommodation of the eye for a person having normal vision normal eyesight is about dioptres .
os . poe doo e . na n ray goes from rarer to denser medium ni n . ray goes from denser to rarer medium ny nz . fig . . remember that optically denser does not mean greater mass density mass per unit volume . for example . kerosene is lighter than water it floats on water . but it has higher refractive index . that is . it is optically denser than water . when light goes from the optically rarer medium to the optically denser medium . it slows down and bends towards the normal . and when it goes from the denser medium to the rarer medium . it speeds up and bends away from the normal .
varieties there are four varieties of coal classified on the basis of carbon content . name carbon i peat ii lignite iii bituminous iv anthracite coal with higher carbon content delivers more energy . it makes anthracite as the best quality coal .
when a wire is moved in a magnetic field between the poles of a magnet . then the free electrons present in the wire experience a force . this force makes the electrons move along the wire . and the movement of these electrons produces current in the wire . we are spending energy from our body in moving the wire up and down in the magnetic field . so . it is the energy spent by us in moving the wire in the magnetic field which is getting converted into electrical energy in the wire and producing an electric current in the wire . thus . the movement of a wire in a magnetic field can produce electric current . so . we can generate electricity by moving a wire continuously in the magnetic field between the poles of a magnet . this principle is used in producing electricity through generators . a generator uses the movement or rotation of a rectangular coil of wire between the poles of a horseshoe magnet to produce an electric current or electricity . thus . the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction is used in the production of electricity by a generator .
moreover . linear magnification can be represented by the following equations size of the image v f v i m size of the objectu f f u where f is the focal length of the lens . the following points should be kept in mind while dealing with linear magnification . if the magnification of a lens is negative . then the image formed is inverted and real . . if the magnification of a lens is positive . then the image formed is erect and virtual . . since a concave lens always produces a virtual image . therefore . the magnification for a concave lens is always positive .

recombination of colours of spectrum to give white light isaac newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain the spectrum of sunlight . he tried to split the colours of the spectrum of white light further by using another similar prism . however . he could not get any more colours . he then placed a second identical prism in an inverted position with respect to the first prism . as shown in figure .
sign convention with spherical mirrors . we generally come across four distances parallel to and two distances perpendicular to the principal axis . each of these six distances has a particular mathematical quantity associated with it . these quantities are given in table . . table . distance quantity symbol from the pole to the object from the pole to the image from the pole to the focus from the pole to the centre height of the object height of the image object distance image distance focal length radius of curvature object height image height the above definitions of u and v are for a point object placed on the principal axis . if an object is placed away from the principal axis . u corresponds to the distance from the pole to the foot of the perpendicular drawn from the object to the principal axis . similarly . v corresponds to the distance from the pole to the foot of the perpendicular drawn from the image to the principal axis . the quantities h . and he are defined for a linear . extended object placed perpendicular to the principal axis . for finding a particular distance when some others are given . we need to assign these quantities u . v . f . r . ho . he positive or negative signs according to a fixed set of rules . or a convention . several conventions for the signs of these quantities are in use . we shall follow the cartesian coordinates convention the sign convention for the distances parallel to the principal axis is as follows . coordinate convention for u . v . f . r u . v . f and r are measured from the pole . if a distance is measured along the incident rays . the corresponding quantity is positive . if a distance is measured opposite to the incident rays . the corresponding quantity is negative . for example . in figure . a . the rays are incident from the left to the right . to measure the object distance we have to measure from the pole to the object . i . e . . from the right to the left . this
broadly . lenses are of the following types trar rarar biconvex lens equiconvex lens plano convex lens concavo convex lens r r k biconcave equiconcave plano concave lens lens convexo concave lens lens note for mirror . it is so because for an inverted image v is negative in case of mirrors while it is positive in case of lenses .

ocean thermal energy ote heat energy of the sun is absorbed by the surface water of the sea or ocean which increases the temperature of upper layers while the temperature of the deeper layers of water is relatively low . the energy extracted due to difference in the temperature of water at the surface of sea and deep below the sea is called ocean thermal energy .
this means that if we join two resistances of ohms and ohms in parallel then their combined resistance is only ohms which is less than either of the two individual resistances of ohms and ohms . thus . when a number of resistances are connected in parallel then their combined resistance is less than the smallest individual resistance . this is due to the fact that when we have two or more resistances joined parallel to one another . then the same current gets additional paths to flow and the overall resistance decreases . before we derive a formula for the resultant resistance of a number of resistances connected in parallel . we should keep in mind that i when a number of resistances are connected in parallel . then the potential difference across each resistance is the same which is equal to the voltage of the battery applied . ii when a number of resistances connected in parallel are joined to the two terminals of a battery . then different amounts of current flow through each resistance which depends on the value of resistance . but the current flowing through all the individual parallel resistances . taken together . is equal to the current flowing in the circuit as a whole . thus . when a number of resistances are connected in parallel . then the sum of the currents flowing through all the resistances is equal to the total current flowing in the circuit .

numerical problems based on convex mirrors in order to solve the numerical problems based on convex mirrors . we should remember that the mirror formula for a convex mirror is the same as that for a concave mirror . which is v u f where v image distance u object distance and f focal length please note that since a convex mirror always forms an image behind the mirror on the right side of the mirror . therefore . the image distance v in the case of convex mirrors is always positive . the object is always placed to the left of mirror . so the object distance u is always taken with a negative sign . the focus of a convex mirror is behind the mirror on its right side . therefore . the focal length of a convex mirror is always taken as positive . the two magnification formulae for convex mirror are also just the same as that for a concave mirror . that is and m v where the symbols have their usual meaning . let us now solve one numerical problem based on convex mirror . m u
tyndall effect the scattering of light by particles in its path is called tyndall effect . when a beam of sunlight enters a dusty room through a window . then its path becomes visible to us . this is because the tiny dust particles present in the air of room scatter the beam of light all around the room . and when this scattered light enters our eyes . we can see the beam of light . thus . an example of tyndall effect is the way a beam of sunlight becomes visible as it passes through dust particles in the air of a room . tyndall effect can also be observed when sunlight passes through the canopy of a dense forest . here . tiny water droplets in the mist scatter sunlight see figure .

the defect of eye called hypermetropia or long sightedness is caused i due to low converging power of eye lens because of its large focal length . or ii due to eye ball being too short . in some cases . the ciliary muscles attached to the eye lens become weak and cannot make the eye lens thicker to increase its converging power . so . due to the low converging power of eye lens in an eye suffering from hypermetropia . the image of nearby object is formed behind the retina and hence the eye cannot see it clearly . in other cases . in an eye suffering from hypermetropia . the eye ball is too short due to which the retina is at a smaller distance from the eve lens . this condition also results in the
electricity is indispensable to us . from the humble torch to the powerful computer . thousands of things we use every day need electricity to work . the source of all electricity is charge . as charge is the basis of all electrical phenomena . we often need to know the amount of charge on a body . it is measured in coulombs . the coulomb is the si unit of charge and its symbol is c . as you know . matter is generally made of protons . electrons and neutrons . each proton carries a charge of . x coulomb . and each electron carries an equal negative charge . neutrons do not carry any net charge . normally . a body has equal number of protons and electrons . and is therefore . electrically neutral . however . in certain situations . the balance of charges in a body is disturbed . for example . when a glass rod is rubbed with a silk cloth . some electrons get transferred from the glass rod to the silk . the silk cloth . which gains electrons . becomes negatively charged . and the glass rod . which is left with more protons than electrons . becomes positively charged . charged particles or objects can exert forces on each other . while like similar charges repel each other . unlike charges attract . another important thing about charged particles is that they can flow . i . e . . they can move in a particular direction . this flow of charged particles is called an electric current . charged particles such as electrons are present in all substances . but . they do not flow on their own . for flow of charges . there has to be a potential difference .

 ii the rays of light coming from a nearby object are diverging or spreading out when they reach the eye see figure b . the diverging rays coming from a nearby object need a convex eye lens of high converging power to converge them or focus them to form an image on the retina of the eye . the convex eye lens of high converging power is the one having a short focal length and it is quite thick . keeping these points in mind . it will now be easy for us to understand the power of accommodation of the eye .

the regular reflection of light from a smooth surface can be explained as follows all the particles of a smooth surface like a plane mirror are facing in one direction . due to this the angle of incidence for all the parallel rays of light falling on a smooth surface is the same and hence the angle of reflection for all the rays of light is also the same . since the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection are the same or equal . a beam of parallel rays of light falling on a smooth surface is reflected as a beam of parallel light rays in one direction only see figure .
by saying that the object is between f and f . we mean that the object is at a distance greater than focal length f but less than twice the focal length f . so . whether we say that the object is between f and f or between fand f . it means the same thing . figure shows an object ab placed between f and f of a convex lens . a ray of light ad which is parallel to the principal axis passes through the focus f after refraction and goes in the direction df see figure . another ray of light ac passing through the centre c of the lens goes straight and meets the first refracted ray at point a on the right side of the lens . thus . a is the real image of point a of the object . draw a b perpendicular to the axis to get the complete image a b . if we place a screen at b . we can receive the image a b on the screen . it should be noted

a coil is made by winding several turns of insulated wire in a circular form . when a current passes through a coil . each turn produces its own magnetic field . these fields together give rise to a net magnetic field that is stronger than that produced by a circular loop of single turn . if a coil has n turns . the magnetic field due to the coil is n times stronger than that due to a single turn . in fact . the strength of the magnetic field due to a current carrying circular coil is proportional to the number of turns and the current . the direction of the magnetic field b at a point on the axis of a current carrying circular coil or a loop a can be found from the following right hand thumb rule . if the fingers of the right hand are curled along the direction of the current in a loop . the stretched thumb gives the direction of the magnetic field figure . .

magnetic field due to a solenoid when a long insulated wire is tightly wound in the shape of a spring . with closely spaced turns that lie side by side . we get a solenoid figure . a . generally . a solenoid is made by winding wire over a nonconducting cylindrical tube . a solenoid differs from a circular coil in that the length of the solenoid is much greater than its diameter . when a current enters a solenoid at one end . it passes through each turn before coming out at the other end . each turn produces its own magnetic field . the net magnetic field is as represented by the magnetic field lines in figure . b . note that the pattern of field lines outside the solenoid is similar to that of a bar magnet figure . b . actually . a current carrying solenoid behaves like a bar magnet of the same shape . it also has opposite poles at its ends . the magnetic field inside a long current carrying solenoid is nearly uniform and is parallel to the axis of the solenoid . this is true for the inner part of the solenoid . away from the ends . near the ends the magnetic field decreases . imagine holding the solenoid in your right hand . with the fingers curled along the direction of the current . the direction of the thumb then gives the direction of the magnetic field . it also points towards the end where the north pole of the solenoid appears . another way of finding the north pole of a solenoid is to check which end gets repelled by the north pole of a bar magnet . how are the fields of a current carrying solenoid and coil different the field inside a current carrying solenoid is quite uniform for the most part . it only decreases near the ends . the field of a current carrying coil is not uniform . it changes with distance from the centre .

when the same eye has to look at a nearby object . the ciliary muscles of the eyes contract . the contracted ciliary muscles make the suspensory ligaments loose . when the suspensory ligaments become loose . they stop pulling the eye lens . the eye lens bulges under its own elasticity and becomes thick or more convex see figure b . the thick eye lens has small focal length but its converging power is large . since the converging power of eye lens increases . the thick eye lens can converge the diverging light rays coming from the nearby object to form an image on the retina of the eye . this is shown in figure b in which an object o is near to the eye . it has been focused by the thick eye lens to form an image i on the retina . when the eye lens becomes more convex to focus the nearby objects . the eye is said to be accommodated . we can now say that the ability of an eye to focus the distant objects as well as the nearby objects on the retina by changing the focal length or converging power of its lens is called accommodation .

in a metal . the flow of negative charges constitutes the current . an electric current can also be a flow of positive charges . so . a flow of charge is called an electric current . by convention . the direction of current is taken as the direction of flow of positive charges . thus . the direction of current is opposite to the direction of flow of negative charges . so . when a wire is connected to a cell . the current in the wire is from the positive terminal end to the negative terminal end .
consider a metallic wire acb connected across a cell of potential difference v . since the end a is connected to the positive terminal . it is at a higher potential than the end b . in metals . some electrons are loosely bound to the atoms . and can move within it . these are called free electrons . in the metallic wire . these electrons negative charges move from the low potential side b to the high potential side a . after reaching a . they enter the cell . the chemical reactions in the cell drive these electrons to the negative terminal . from there . they re enter the wire at the end b . thus . there is a continuous flow of electrons in the wire from b to c to a . we say that there is an electric current in the wire .

fleming s left hand rule for the direction of force when a current carrying wire is placed in a magnetic field . a force is exerted on the wire . fleming gave a simple rule to determine the direction of force acting on a current carrying wire placed in a magnetic field . this rule is known as fleming s left hand rule and it can be stated as follows . according to fleming s left hand rule hold the forefinger . the centre finger and the thumb of your left hand at right angles to one another as shown in figure a . adjust your hand in such a way that the forefinger points in the direction of magnetic field and the centre finger points in the direction of current . then the direction in which thumb points . gives the direction of force acting on the conductor . since the conductor say . a wire moves along the direction in which the force acts on it . we can also say that the direction in which
direction of magnetic field produced by straight current carrying conductor straight current carrying wire if the direction of current is known . then the direction of magnetic field produced by a straight wire carrying current can be obtained by using maxwell s right hand thumb rule . according to maxwell s right hand thumb rule imagine that you are grasping or holding the current carrying wire in your right
 . to demonstrate electromagnetic induction by using a straight wire and a horseshoe type magnet in figure a . we have a straight wire ab held between the poles n and s of a horseshoe magnet which is a u shaped magnet . the two ends of wire are connected to a current detecting instrument called galvanometer . when the wire ab is held standstill between the poles of the horseshoe magnet . then there is no deflection in the galvanometer pointer . this shows that no current is produced in the wire when it is held stationary in the magnetic field .
we will now give some important points about the fuse wire to be used in electrical circuits . first of all we should know why we use a thin wire as a fuse wire and not a thick wire . we use a thin wire in a fuse because it has a much greater resistance than the rest of connecting wires . due to its high resistance . the heating effect of current will be much more in the fuse wire than anywhere else in the circuit . this will melt the fuse wire whereas other wiring will remain safe . we should not use a thick wire as a fuse wire because it will have a low resistance and hence it will not get heated to its melting point easily . the fuse wire is usually made from tin plated copper wire having low melting point so that it may melt easily . a pure copper wire cannot be used as a fuse wire because it has a high melting point due to which it will not melt easily when a short circuit takes place .

conclusion we know that the electric current is the flow of electrons through a conductor . the electrons . however . are not completely free to move in a conductor . when the electrons move from one part of the conductor to the other part . they collide with other electrons and with the positive ions protons present in the conductor . these collisions slow down the speed of electrons . this property of the conductor by virtue of which it opposes the flow of electrons electric current through it is called electric resistance . in this activity . every conductor . i . e . nichrome wire . torch bulb . w bulb offered resistance to the electric current but to a different extent . so . we observed that the current flowing through the circuit was different for different components .

the blue colour of the clear sky in white light . the blue colour has smallest wavelength and in the atmosphere the molecules of air and other fine particles have sizes smaller than the wavelength of visible light . therefore blue light is scattered more than any other colour . that is why sky appears blue . if earth had no atmosphere there would not have been any scattering and the sky would have looked dark . that is why it appears dark to the passengers flying at very high altitudes . as scattering is not prominent at such heights .
read a book with the spectacles . this person must keep the book at a distance greater than cm so that the image of the book by the concave lens is produced not closer than cm . the angular size of the book or its image at the greater distance is evidently less than the angular size when the book is placed at cm and spectacles are not needed . hence . the person prefers to remove the spectacles while reading .

 ii inversely proportional to the radius of circular loop or circular wire . in this discussion we have considered the magnetic field produced by a circular loop or circular wire which consists of only one turn of the wire . the strength of magnetic field can be increased by taking a circular coil consisting of a number of turns of insulated copper wire closely wound together . thus . if there is a circular coil having n turns . the magnetic field produced by this current carrying circular coil will be n times as large as that produced by a circular loop of a single turn of wire . this is because the current in each circular turn of coil flows in the same direction and magnetic field produced by each turn of circular coil then just adds up . we can now say that the strength of magnetic field produced by a circular coil carrying current is directly proportional to both . number of turns n and current i but inversely proportional to its radius r . thus . the strength of magnetic field produced by a current carrying circular coil can be increased i by increasing the number of turns of wire in the coil . ii by increasing the current flowing through the coil . and iii by decreasing the radius of the coil .
electromagnetic induction electricity from magnetism we have already studied that an electric current can produce magnetism . the reverse of this is also true . that is . magnetism or magnets can produce electric current . the production of electricity from magnetism is called electromagnetic induction . for example . when a straight wire is moved up and down rapidly between the two poles of a horseshoe magnet . then an electric current is produced in the wire . this is an example of electromagnetic induction . again . if a bar magnet is moved in and out of a coil of wire . even then an electric current is produced in the coil . this is also an example of electromagnetic induction .
atmospheric refraction when sunlight enters the earth s atmosphere . then it continuously goes from rarer to the denser medium therefore . refraction of light takes place . the refraction of light taking place in the atmosphere is known as atmospheric refraction .
the rule can be remembered with help of the following tip shown in figure .
concave or convex . if both the surfaces of a lens are convex . it is called a double convex or biconvex lens . it is a type of convex lens . and the type of concave lens in which both the surfaces are concave is called a double concave or biconcave lens . b d convex concave convex concave fig . . lenses of all kinds can be made very thin . such lenses are called thin lenses . figure . shows two thin lenses which have been divided into small sections . notice that the middle section of each lens is almost rectangular . so . a ray of light incident on this section is displaced parallel to itself . and the displacement is proportional to the thickness of the section . for a thin lens . the displacement of a ray incident near its middle is negligible . and the ray passes through the lens almost without deviation . in our discussions we will assume that all the lenses are thin . also . we will assume that the aperture the surface of the lens is small . note that in the diagrams the width of the lens has been kept to give you a clear picture . and it fig . . does not indicate the actual thickness of the lens .
dx by a solid line . now . dx is the first refracted ray which appears to be coming from focus f of the concave lens .
the refractive index of a medium is more for violet light and less for red light . because in a medium red light travels faster than violet light . when the colour of light is not mentioned . the refractive index is written for yellow light . for example . if the refractive index for glass is . . it means this refractive index of glass is for yellow light .
a ray of light passing through the focus after refraction becomes parallel to the principal axis .
a major drawback of solar panels is the availability of efficient systems to store the energy generated by the cells and make it available when required . although batteries are used to store the energy . but these batteries are unable to operate devices working on alternating current as these batteries store energy in the form of direct current .
in both cases . faraway objects cannot be seen clearly . although nearby objects can . though parallel rays focus short of the retina . a divergent beam coming from a point o gets focused on the retina . when the focal length of the eye lens is maximum figure . b . then . for this person . o is the far point . clearly . the far point of a myopic person is much closer than infinity .
but there are certain phenomena in which . light behaves as a particle . the most striking of these phenomena is the photoelectric effect an effect in which electrons are ejected out of a metal surface when light of suitable frequency is incident on it . also discovered by hertz . this was in contradiction of the wave theory .
space vacated by hot air . it is this moving air which is called wind .
the resistance which can be changed as desired is called variable resistance . variable resistance has two symbols shown in figure g . variable resistance is also known as rheostat . rheostat is a variable resistance which is usually operated by a sliding contact on a long coil made of resistance wire . a rheostat is used to change the current in a circuit without changing the voltage source like the cell or battery . it can do so by changing the resistance of the circuit . the galvanometer is a current detecting instrument which we will come across in the next chapter . the switch or plug key is a device for making or breaking an electric circuit . when the switch is open . then the circuit breaks and no current flows in it see figure k . but when the switch is closed . then the circuit is made or completed and current flows in it see figure .

 . thin lenses have you ever touched the glass used in spectacles or the one used by watchmakers to see tiny parts . is the surface of this glass plane or curved is it thicker in the middle or at the edges you will find that the surface of this glass is not plane it is curved . these glasses are examples of lenses . now . let us find out what a lens is and what use we make of it . the most familiar and widely used optical device is the lens .
the fuel which we choose should be cheap and easily available . another point which we have to keep in mind is that the fuel should be easy to handle . safe to transport and convenient to store . the fuel should have low percentage of non combustible materials . this means that the residue left behind after the burning of a fuel should be as low as possible . for example . coal is a fuel which leaves behind a lot of ash after burning . the removal and disposal of ash poses a big problem in factories and power plants where large quantities of coal are burnt everyday . the fuel should burn smoothly and at a steady rate . this is teady rate . this is because if a fuel burns too fast . then most of the heat produced by it will be
in this case . light from a distant object is focused in front of the retina fig . . the distinguishing feature of this condition is that distant objects are not seen clearly .
the non renewable sources of energy are also called conventional sources of energy . the non renewable sources of energy like fossil fuels coal . petroleum and natural gas are present in a limited amount in the earth . once exhausted . they will not be available to us again . the nuclear fuels like uranium have been put in the category of non renewable sources of energy because the nuclear materials which can be conveniently extracted from the earth are limited and hence they will get exhausted one day . please note that since the non renewable sources of energy can get exhausted one day . they are also known as exhaustible sources of energy . another point to be noted is that though nuclear fuels are non renewable source of energy dug out from the earth . they are not conventional source of energy .
controlling pollution caused by fossil fuels the pollution caused by burning fossil fuels can be controlled or reduced to some extent by increasing the efficiency of the combustion process . and by using various techniques to reduce the escape of harmful gases and ash into the surrounding air . this will become clear from the following discussion .
 i dust particles and water droplets suspended in the atmosphere are much larger than the wavelength range of visible light . when white light coming from the sun hits these larger particles . it gets reflected or
 . heating effect of current . . joule s heating when the ends of a conductor are connected to a battery . then free electrons move with drift velocity and electric current flows through the wire . these electrons collide continuously with the positive ions of the wire and thus the energy taken from the battery is dissipated . to maintain the electric current in the wire . energy is taken continuously from the battery . this energy is transformed to the ions of the wire by the electrons . this increases the thermal motion of the ions as a result the temperature of the wire rises . the effect of electric current due to which heat is produced in a wire when current is passed through it is called heating effect of current or joule heating . in joule found that when current is passed through a conductor the

electricity can be classified into two parts . static electricity . and . current electricity . in static electricity . the electric charges remain at rest or stationary . they do not move . the charge acquired by a glass rod rubbed with a silk cloth and the charge acquired by an ebonite rod rubbed with a woollen cloth are the examples of static electricity . the lightning which we see in the sky during the rainy season also involves static electricity . in current electricity . the electric charges are in motion and produce an electric current . the electricity which we use in our homes is the current electricity see figure . in this chapter . we will discuss only current electricity in detail . so . when we talk of electricity in these discussions . it will actually mean current electricity .
r resistors in parallel when two or more resistors are combined in such a way that their first ends are connected to one point and the second ends to another point then this combination is in parallel . in this combination the potential difference between the ends of all the resistors is same but the current in different resistances are different . in figure three resistors r . r and r are joined in parallel between the points a and b . suppose the current flowing from the cell is i . at the point a . this current is divided into three parts . suppose . and are the currents in r . r and r respectively . at the point b . these three currents meet and form the main current i . thus . we have i . . . i let the potential difference between the points a and b be v . since each resistance is connected between a and b . the potential difference between the ends of each will be v . therefore 
colour blindness can develop as a result of eye infection or eye damage . usually colour blindness is an inherited trait genetic disorder affecting the cones .
the case of light going from air into glass and again into air we have just studied the refraction of light from air into glass figure . and from glass into air figure . we will now show these two types of refraction in the same diagram . in other words . we will now show the complete path of a ray of light when it passes from air into glass slab and again into air . this is shown in figure .
gas is found in the same rocks as coal and oil . it . too . was formed from the half decayed remains of plants . animals and bacteria . gas is often only found in small amounts . because it can easily leak away through tiny spaces in rocks .
 vi images an image is a point or plane to which rays are converged or from which they appear to diverge after reflection or refraction of light . when we comb our hair while standing in front of a plane mirror . we see our image in the mirror . we ourselves are object and what we see in the mirror is our image . when we watch a movie in a cinema house we are actually watching images of the actors on the screen . images are formed at the point where rays of light actually intersect or at the point from where they appear to originate . images are classified as a real and b virtual .
in case of a concave mirror . the rays of light incident parallel to the principal axis . after reflection actually meet at point f . on the other hand . in case of a convex mirror . the rays of light incident parallel to principal axis . after reflection from the mirror do not meet at f but appear to come from it . when produced backward . rays come together at focal point in front light rays of mirror normal normal light p rays m rays come together at focal point behind m mirror reflected rays convex mirror reflected rays concave mirror

 in dispersion of white light . violet light bends the most and red light bends the least . the phenomenon in which a part of the light incident on a particle is redirected in different directions is called scattering of light . very small particles scatter lights of shorter wavelengths bluish lights better than longer wavelengths . the scattering of longer wavelengths of light reddish lights increases as the size of the particles increases . large particles scatter lights of all wavelengths equally well .

as a reflector in street lamps the light incident on the lamp is reflected by the convex mirror and reflected light spreads in the form of a divergent beam . therefore . light spreads over a larger area .
the deviation produced by a prism when white light is incident on it increases with the increasing refractive index and frequency and decreasing wavelength . violet light is deviated most . and red is deviated least other colours are in intermediate positions . when it comes out of the prism . light is spread in a fan shaped beam as shown in figure . . this fan shaped beam or the band of the coloured components of light is termed as a spectrum . light is said to be dispersed into a spectrum consisting of violet . indigo . blue . green . yellow . orange and red . the acronym short form vibgyor is a handy mnemonic aid to memory for remembering the order of the colours produced by a prism or those in the rainbow . indigo is included mostly for the mnemonic people can seldom distinguish it from blue or violet .

the first steps towards correctly explaining the colour of the sky were taken by john tyndall in . he discovered that when light passes through a clear fluid holding small particles in suspension . the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more strongly than the red . this can be demonstrated by shining a beam of white light through a tank of water with a little milk or soap mixed in fig . . from the side the beam can be seen by the blue light it scatters . but the light seen directly from the end is reddened after it has passed through the tank . the scattered light can also be shown to be polarised using a filter of polarised light . just as the sky appears a deeper blue through polarised sunglasses .

 . presbyopia in old age . due to ciliary muscles becoming weak and the eye lens becoming inflexible or rigid . the eye loses its power of accommodation . because of this an old person cannot see the nearby objects clearly . this leads to the defect called presbyopia . presbyopia is that defect of vision due to which an old person cannot see the nearby objects clearly due to loss of power of accommodation of the eye . for example . an old person having presbyopia cannot read a book or newspaper comfortably and clearly without spectacles . presbyopia occurs in old age due to the gradual weakening of the ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of the eye lens . the near point of the old person having presbyopia gradually recedes and becomes much more than centimetres away . actually . presbyopia is a special kind of hypermetropia . we can call it old age hypermetropia . presbyopia is the hypermetropia or long sightedness caused by the loss of power of accommodation of the eye due to old age . presbyopia defect is corrected in the same way as hypermetropia by using spectacles having convex lenses see figure .

strength of the magnetic field due to the current in a straight wire a compass needle gets deflected when kept near a current carrying wire . if the current in the wire is increased by applying a greater potential difference across it . the needle gets deflected by a larger angle . this means that the strength of the magnetic field increases with increase in current . in fact . the strength of the magnetic field produced by an electric current is directly proportional to the current if you move a compass away from a current carrying wire . you will notice that as the distance of the compass from the wire increases . the deflection of its needle decreases . this means that the strength of the magnetic field reduces with distance from the wire . for a long . straight current carrying wire . the strength of the magnetic field is inversely proportional to the distance .

 ii the air molecules nitrogen and oxygen gas molecules present in the atmosphere are smaller than the wavelength range of visible light . so . when light coming from the sun hits these very small air molecules . it behaves differently . since the different colours of white light have different wavelengths . so they are affected differently . the lower wavelength lights blues are scattered much more by the air molecules but the higher wavelength lights reds are scattered much less . thus . when white sunlight falls on the extremely small particles like air molecules present in the atmosphere . it is not scattered as white light . the molecules of air scatter mainly the lower wavelengths of light which have blue shades .

construction of a motor an electric motor consists of a rectangular coil abcd of insulated copper wire . which is mounted between the curved poles of a horseshoe type permanent magnet m in such a way that it can rotate freely between the poles n and s on a shaft the shaft is a long cylindrical rotating rod at the centre of the coil which has not been shown in figure to keep the diagram simple . the sides ab and cd of the coil are kept perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field between the poles of the magnet . this is done so that the maximum magnetic force is exerted on the current carrying sides ab and cd of the coil . a device which reverses the direction of current through a circuit is called a commutator or split ring . the two ends of the coil are soldered or welded permanently to the two half rings x and y of a commutator . a commutator is a copper ring split into two parts x and y . these two parts are insulated from one another and mounted on the shaft of the motor . end a of the coil is welded to part x of the commutator and end d of the coil is welded to part y of the commutator . the commutator rings are mounted on the shaft of the coil and they also rotate when the coil rotates . as we will see later on . the function of commutator rings is to reverse the direction of current flowing through the coil every time the coil just passes the vertical position during a revolution . in other words . commutator rings reverse the direction of current flowing through the coil after every half rotation of the coil .

when a soft iron core is used as a core material . a very strong magnetic field is produced . commonly an insulated wire is coiled over a non conducting hollow cylindrical tube . an iron rod is usually placed inside the hollow tube . this iron rod is called the core . a strong magnetic field produced inside a solenoid can be used to magnetize a piece of magnetic material . like soft iron . when placed inside the coil fig . . the magnet so formed is called an electromagnet .
domestic electric circuits or domestic wiring electricity is generated at the power station . it is brought to our homes by two thick copper wires or aluminium wires fixed over tall electric poles or by underground cables . from the electric pole situated in our street . two insulated wires l and n come to our house see figure . one of these wires is called live wire read as laa ive wire and it is at a high potential of volts whereas the other wire is called neutral wire and it is at the ground potential of zero volt . thus . the potential difference between the live wire and the neutral wire in india is volts . in figure . l is the live wire and n is the neutral wire . the live wire has red insulation covering whereas neutral wire has black insulation covering . there is no harm if we touch the neutral wire but we will get an electric shock if . by chance . we touch the live wire .

the above experiment shows that when the direction of motion of wire in the magnetic field is reversed . then the direction of induced current is also reversed . please note that the direction of induced current in the wire can also be reversed by reversing the positions of the poles of the magnet which means that the direction of induced current can also be reversed by reversing the direction of magnetic field . we will now discuss why the movement of a wire in the magnetic field produces an electric current in the wire .

image of an extended object or finite object we have just studied that a plane mirror forms a point image of a point object . but most of the actual objects are much bigger than a mere point and they are called extended objects or finite objects . an extended object or bigger object can be considered to be made up of a very . very large number of point objects . so . the image of an extended object is a collection of the image points corresponding to the various points of the object . we will now describe how a plane mirror forms the image of an extended object . in our ray diagrams . we will use an arrow pointing upwards to represent an extended object or finite object .

fossil fuels t fuels that were formed from the remains of dead plants and animals are called fossil fuels . these were produced by complex processes with the help of a series of natural events over millions of years . the most widely used fossil fuels are coal . petroleum and natural gas . you know that plants trap solar energy in the form of food . and animals get energy when they eat the plants . since fossil fuels came from plants and animals . their ultimate source of energy is the sun . we get a number of different fuels from coal and petroleum . for example . we get petrol . diesel . kerosene and lpg from petroleum . and coke and natural gas from coal . when burnt in air . fossil fuels give off heat . which is used for various purposes from cooking to generating electricity . however . these fuels are nonrenewable . and their reserves are running out . unfortunately . we cannot repeat the events that led to their formation . fossil fuels have played an important role in the technological advances made in the last three hundred years or so . even today . most of the energy requirements of homes . industries and transport are met by fossil fuels . it is estimated that about of our total energy consumption comes from coal . more than of this coal is used for electricity generation in thermal power plants . in most thermal power plants . coal is burnt to heat water for producing steam . the steam falls on the blades of a special kind of wheel called a turbine . a turbine is a device that rotates when steam . water or wind falls on its blades . the turbine turns the shaft of an electric generator to which it is connected . in this way electricity is produced .

 . when the object lies beyond the centre of curvature c consider a ray starting from the top of the object and parallel to the principal axis . this ray after reflection from the mirror seems to come from the focus . another ray of light starting from the top of the object and travelling towards the centre of curvature reflects back on itself . the two rays when produced backwards seem to meet behind the mirror . this is the image of the object . fig . . this image formed is virtual . erect and diminished .
dispersion of light by a prism as with any transparent material . lights of different colours travel at different speeds in the material of a prism . hence . the refractive index of the material of a prism is different for different colours of light . so . when white light enters a prism . its different components lights of different colours bend by different amounts . this causes the components to separate out . or split . while emerging from the prism . they undergo a second refraction and bend further . increasing the separation between the colours . in this way . white light gets split into its component colours on passing through a prism . note that the component colours of white light bend by different amounts for all refractions . so . why does not light get split while passing through a rectangular slab light bends by equal angles but in opposite directions at the parallel faces of a rectangular slab . so . the components of light that split at the first refraction bend back and recombine to give white light after the second refraction .

in the fission of uranium . the combined mass of the fission products is less than the combined mass of the neutron and the u nucleus . with which the reaction started . this loss in mass gets converted into energy . energy released in fission reactions you must have heard of einstein s famous equation . e mcÂ² . in this equation . e . m and c stand for energy . mass and the speed of light in vacuum respectively . from this equation we can get the amount of energy released when matter of a certain mass is destroyed . taking c x m s in vacuum . kg of disappearing mass will give rise to x j of energy . when dealing with atoms and nuclei . scientists prefer to measure mass in a unit called atomic mass unit u . which is defined as of the mass of one atom of carbon . and they often use the unit electronvolt ev to measure energy . u . x kg . ev . x j . it turns out that u of mass . when converted into energy . releases about mev of energy . how much energy do we get from the fission of one uranium nucleus from the fission of one u nucleus . we get about x ev mev of energy . to get an idea of the amount of energy liberated by fission . let us do a comparison with energy released by burning coal . when g of coal is burnt completely . kj of energy is produced . a fission reaction that consumes g of u produces . x kj of energy the energy released in nuclear fission can be used to generate electricity as well as to make atom bombs .

in the above experiment we have seen that when a wire is moved between the poles of a fixed magnet . then an electric current is produced in the wire . the reverse of this is also true . that is . if a wire in the form of a coil is kept fixed but a magnet is moved inside it . even then a current is produced in the coil of wire . this point will become more clear from the following experiment .

 . sou twinkling of stars twinkle . twinkle little star may have been the first rhyme you learnt . but maybe you are still wondering what makes stars twinkle . when we look at stars . quite often they do not appear to shine steadily . they disappear for a fraction of a second before reappearing the intensity of light from them fluctuates . or their positions seem to shift slightly in random directions . we call this the twinkling of stars . let us see why this happens . since the temperature of air and its humidity are not the same everywhere in the atmosphere . the refractive index of air varies between different masses or pockets of air . even at the same altitude . thus . there exist air pockets whose refractive index is different from that of the air surrounding it . when a ray of light passes through such a pocket of air . it bends due to refraction figure . . light from a star may pass through one or more air pockets before reaching the eye . but the air pockets keep moving . so . the direction of the ray reaching the eye keeps changing . causing the image of air pockets of different the star to shift in random directions or even densities disappear for an instant . the amount of starlight reaching the eye also keeps changing due to the shift in the direction of the light . so . the brightness of the star seems fig . . to change . the stars near the horizon twinkle more than those that are overhead . this is because light from a star near the horizon has to cover much more distance in the atmosphere than that from stars which are overhead . therefore . it has greater chances of encountering air pockets whose density is different from the surrounding air . why planets do not twinkle planets do not seem to twinkle like stars . although light coming from them also passes through the air pockets in the atmosphere . this is because stars appear as point objects to us due to their enormous distance from the earth . on the other hand . planets are comparatively nearer . and therefore . for us they are more like extended objects . light from different parts of the planet form an extended image at the eye . and we are unable to detect the random shifts in the smaller portions of this image . po so 
a concave mirror can form images which are smaller than the object . equal to the object or bigger than the object . therefore . the linear magnification or just magnification m produced by a concave mirror can be less than . equal to or more than . on the other hand . a convex mirror forms images which are always smaller than the object . so the linear magnification m produced by a convex mirror is always less than . a plane mirror forms images which are always of the same size as the object . therefore . the magnification m produced by a plane mirror is always .

what happens if we move the coil instead of the magnet fix the coil to a wooden block . and move it sharply towards the magnet . you will find that as long as the coil moves . there is a current in the coil . as indicated by the deflection of the needle of the galvanometer figure . a . and if you move the coil away from the magnet . the needle of the galvanometer gets deflected in the opposite direction figure . b . there is no deflection . i . e . . no current . when both of them are at rest .
 v as we move towards the centre of the coil . the strength of magnetic field increases . magnetic field is maximum at its centre . this is due to the reason that the two magnetic fields one due to the semicircular segment of the coil through a and the other due to the semicircular segment through b assist each other .

 a v ceases to be proportional to figure a . b the relation between v and i depends on the sign of v . in other words . if i is the current for a certain v . then reversing the direction of v keeping its magnitude fixed . does not produce a current of the same magnitude as i in the opposite direction figure b . this happens . for example . in a diode . c the relation between v and i is not unique . i . e . . there is more than one value of v for the same current i . a material exhibiting such behaviour is gaas .

the size of the pupil varies with the help of iris to mm . in dim light . the size of the pupil increases with the help of iris to allow more light to enter the eye . in bright light . the pupil contracts to allow less light to enter into the eye . in other words . the iris regulates the amount of light entering the eye by dilating the pupil in light of low intensity and contracting the pupil in high intensity light fig . .
thus . the phenomenon due to which a magnetic field is produced around a current carrying conductor is magnetic effects of current . the direction of the deflection of the needle can be determined by any one of the following rules 
it should be noted that the adjustment of the size of the pupil takes some time . for example . when we go from a bright light to a darkened cinema hall . at first we cannot see our surroundings clearly . after a short time our vision improves . and we can see the persons sitting around us . this is due to the fact that in bright sunlight the pupil of our eye is small . so . when we enter the darkened cinema hall . very little light enters our eye and we cannot see properly . after

for a fission chain reaction to occur . the fissionable material must have a minimum mass . otherwise . neutrons will escape from the sample before they have the opportunity to strike another nucleus and cause additional fission . the chain stops if enough neutrons are lost . the amount of material is then said to be a subcritical mass . the amount of fissionable material large enough to maintain the chain reaction with a constant rate of fission is called the critical mass . when a critical mass of material is present . only one neutron from each fission is subsequently effective in producing another fission . the critical mass of uranium is about kg . the chain reaction multiplies the number of fission reactions showing very few secondary neutrons to escape if more than a critical mass of fissionable material is present . a mass in excess to critical mass is referred as super critical mass and this leads to a violent nuclear explosion .
we can determine the polarity of electromagnet shown in figure by using the clock face rule . if we view the electromagnet from its left end . we will see that the direction of current flowing in the coil is emil is
scientists believe that the source of geothermal energy lies in radioactive decay deep inside the earth . geothermal resources are classified as low temperature less than c or f moderate temperature c or f and high temperature greater than c or f . these resources range from shallow ground to areas several miles beneath the earth s surface where water and hot rock is found . and all the way down to the extremely molten rock called magma . the ways that these resources are used are influenced by temperature . those resources of high temperature are used for electric power generation . low and moderate temperature resources are used for direct use and heat pumps .
limitations of wind energy a we cannot depend upon wind energy as it is available only when air is in motion . the appliances or machines operating with wind energy stop working as soon as wind stops . the minimum speed of wind to operate generator to produce electricity is about km h . as soon as the speed of the wind becomes less than km h . the generator stops working . b there are certain regions where wind is not available . so the use of wind energy is limited to certain places where wind is in plenty and blows most of the time . c wind energy farms require a large area of land . d wind energy cannot be used to operate all types of machines . e windmills are usually broken during storms and hence lot of money is spent for the maintenance of a wind energy farm .
since it is easier to transmit electricity over long distances than to carry coal oil or gas over the same distance . therefore . many thermal power plants are established near coal fields or oil fields . we produce a major part of our electricity by burning fossil fuels . due to this . large amounts of fossil fuels coal . oil and gas are being burnt everyday at thermal power plants to generate electricity . because our supplies of coal . oil and gas are running out at a rapid rate . and because of the pollution caused by burning fossil fuels . other ways of generating electricity must be found . please note that electricity is not a fuel . it is a form of energy . at thermal power plants . it is the chemical energy of fossil fuels coal . oil and gas which is transformed into electrical energy .
bulb is filled with a chemically unreactive gas like argon or nitrogen or a mixture of both . the gases like argon and nitrogen do not react with the hot tungsten filament and hence prolong the life of the filament of the electric bulb . it should be noted that most of the electric power consumed by the filament of an electric bulb appears as heat due to which the bulb becomes hot . only a small amount of electric power
 . . biomass out of the total solar energy radiant on the earth s surface . a small fraction of it is converted into chemical energy by green plants through a process called photosynthesis . this energy becomes available in the form of biomass stored in different parts of plant . biomass means any organic matter from which we can get energy on a renewable basis . this includes agricultural crop residues . wood . animal excreta . wastes from food processing . municipal wastes . and trees and crops grown specifically for energy purposes . agricultural residues include straw . hay and husk . waste from food processing includes bagasse . which is the residue left after extracting the juice from sugar cane . cow dung gobar has been a traditional biomass fuel in our country . biomass is another form in which solar energy manifests itself .
why is the secondary rainbow fainter than the primary rainbow ans . light suffers two total internal reflections in the formation of secondary rainbow . so more of light intensity is absorbed .
for many materials e . g . . metals . the ratio v i is the same for a given piece of material over a wide range of voltages and currents . in such a case . the resistance is a constant and the relation r v i is referred to as ohm s law . after the german physicist george simon ohm . who discovered it . the above relation is an empirical formula which relates the current flowing through a conductor to the potential difference applied across it .
cause of astigmatism this defect occurs when the cornea is not perfectly spherical in shape . it may have a large curvature in the vertical plane than in the horizontal plane or vice versa . if one looks at a wire mesh with such a defect in the eye lens . focussing in the vertical plane may not be as sharp as in the horizontal plane or vice versa . astigmatism results in lines in one direction well focussed while those in perpendicular direction will be distorted or curved . as shown in figure a

electric cable or overhead wires the electric power to a house is supplied either through overhead wires or through underground cables . the cable has three separate insulated wires a live wire or phase or positive . b neutral wire or negative and c earth wire . the live wire has usually red insulation cover . neutral wire has black insulation cover and the earth wire has green insulation cover . as per the new international convention . live wire has brown coloured insulation cover whereas neutral and earth wires have light blue and green or yellow insulation covers . the potential difference between the live and neutral wire is v . the neutral and the earth wires are connected together at the local sub station so that both of them are at zero potential .
 . . liquefied petroleum gas lpg the main constituent of petroleum gas is butane . which gives out a lot of heat when burnt . butane is easily liquefied under high pressure . in the liquid form . it is supplied in cylinders and is commonly known as liquefied petroleum gas lpg . our domestic gas cylinders contain a mixture of liquefied butane . propane and ethane hydrocarbons . a domestic gas cylinder contains about kg of lpg . smaller cylinders are also available . a strong smelling substance called ethyl mercaptan chsh is added to the lpg to detect the leakage of gas from the cylinder . when the regulator valve of the gas cylinder and the knob of the stove are opened . the pressure over the liquid in the cylinder decreases . as a result . some of it vaporises and reaches the burner through a tube connecting the cylinder to the stove . on being lighted . the gas burns with a blue flame . one gram of lpg produces about kj of heat . it is a clean burning fuel that does not produce pollutants like carbon monoxide and ash .
conventional and non conventional sources of energy sources of energy on the basis of their usability by man . are classified as conventional sources of energy the sources which are used extensively since ancient times and major portion of our energy requirement are met by them e . g . . fossil fuels and hydroenergy are known as conventional sources of energy . biomass energy and wind energy are also conventional sources of energy .

windmills are erected over a large area . which is known as wind energy farm fig . . the energy output of each windmill in a farm is coupled together in series to get electricity on a commercial scale . the minimum wind velocity required is about km h . the overall effectiveness of wind farms depends on the distribution of wind speed over the year .
 . . hypermetropia a person suffering from this defect can see distant objects clearly but cannot see nearby objects clearly . in this defect . the near point lies farther away than cm .
another fuel which has a lower percentage of hydrogen in it . for example . lpg has a higher percentage of hydrogen than coal . so lpg has a higher calorific value than coal . we will now describe the ignition temperature of a fuel . we know that a fuel has to be burnt to obtain heat energy . now . before a fuel can catch fire and burn .
we can stop the wastage of energy . for example . by switching off lights . fans . coolers . etc . . when they are not in use . in large cities . sharing a car with other people going to work in the same area or using public transport can save a lot of fuel . many such commonsense things can be done to save energy . think about this making sure that taps do not leak saves the energy used in pumping extra water .
heating element made of nichrome has a high resistance and produces a lot of heat on passing current . ii nichrome does not undergo oxidation or burn easily even at high temperature . due to this nichrome wire can be kept red hot without burning or breaking in air .
prism quite often we use a glass prism to split white light . a glass prism is a five sided solid with a triangular cross section . thus . it has two parallel . triangular faces and three rectangular faces that are inclined to each other . in experiments . a prism is usually placed on one of its triangular faces such that its rectangular faces are vertical . light falling on a rectangular face adfc in figure . enters the prism and emerges from another rectangular face befc . figure . shows the cross section of a prism on which a ray of light pq is incident . the ray pq makes an angle i with the normal to the surface at q . since the ray enters glass optically denser medium from air . it bends towards the normal . hence . the ray bends towards the base ab . within the prism . the ray travels along qr . and falls on the surface cb at r . at this surface . the ray passes from glass to air . and hence . it bends away from the normal . as a result . the ray bends further towards the base ab . note that for the refraction at the second surface in a prism . it is a convention to denote the angle of incidence by r and the angle of refraction by in . fig . . a ray of light passing through a prism

 iv concave mirrors are used as doctor s head mirrors to focus light coming from a lamp on to the body parts of a patient such as eye . ear . nose . throat . etc . to be examined by the doctor .
if instead of water . we take some other transparent liquid such as kerosene or turpentine in the above two experiments . then the bending of stick or raising of coin will appear to take place by different amounts than that in water . this is because light is refracted by different amounts in different liquids .
experiment to demonstrate the force acting on a current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field the kicking wire experiment a thick copper wire ab is suspended vertically from a support t by means of a flexible joint j figure . the lower end b of this wire is free to move between the poles of a u shaped magnet m . the lower end b of the wire just touches the surface of mercury kept in a shallow vessel v so that it can move when a force acts on it . the positive terminal of a battery is connected to end a of the wire . the circuit is completed
the eye construction and working now that you know the basics of image formation by lenses . you will be able to understand how our eyes work . the eye performs three functions it makes adjustments to admit appropriate amount of light . it bends the rays of light to form a sharp image . and it collects and sends information about the image to the brain for further processing . different parts of the eye perform these functions . figure . a shows schematically the basic components of the human eye . the different parts of the eye are contained within the spherical eyeball . which is about . cm in diameter . an opaque . white . protective membrane called the sclera covers most of the outer part of the eyeball . this is what we call the white of the eye . a small portion at the front of the eyeball bulges out . a transparent protective membrane called the cornea covers this portion . behind the cornea the major structures of the eye are the iris . which controls the amount of light entering the eye . the crystalline lens . which helps in bending light . and the retina . on which the image is formed . as you can see from the diagram . the lens divides the eye into two chambers . the smaller of these two is between the cornea and the lens . it is filled with a watery fluid called
an electric motor is a device which converts electric energy into mechanical energy . a dc motor is based on the principle that a current carrying conductor placed in a uniform magnetic field experiences a force . the direction of this force being given by fleming s left hand rule .
measurement of current the charge passing per unit time through a given place is the magnitude of the electric current at that place . thus . . . . . here q is the charge that passes through a place in time t . unit of current from equation . . we find that current is charge divided by time . the si unit of charge is the coulomb and that of time is the second . the si unit of current . therefore . is coulomb second . this unit is called the ampere . whose symbol is a . thus . if one coulomb of charge passes through a place in one second . the current there is ampere . the ampere is named a
why a change in speed of light causes refraction of light or bending of light . the refraction of light or change in direction of light on going from one medium to another can be explained by using the wave theory of light . a beam of light is made up of tiny waves . when a beam of light consisting of light waves and travelling in a certain medium falls obliquely at an angle on the boundary of another medium . then one part of the light waves enters into the other medium first and its speed changes first but the rest of waves enter the other medium a little later and hence its speed changes a little later . the fact that the speed of light waves on one side of a beam of light changes a little before the change in speed of light waves on its other side . causes a change in the direction of light . and this change in direction of light is called refraction of light or bending of light . this will become more clear from the following example in which a beam of light is entering from air into a glass slab obliquely and then emerging into air from its other side .
real image real image is formed . when reflected or refracted light rays actually intersect at a point . . real image can be obtained on a screen . real image is inverted . i in case of mirror real image is formed in front of a mirror . ii in case of lens real image is formed on the other side of a lens .
suppose we have two fuels a and b . the calorific value of fuel a is kj g and its ignition temperature is c whereas the calorific value of fuel b is kj g and its ignition temperature is c . now . we find that fuel a has a higher calorific value of kj g than that of fuel b . so . at first sight it would appear that fuel a is a better fuel than fuel b . but it is not so . this is because fuel a has a very low ignition temperature of c due to which it can catch fire easily and hence it is unsafe to use . on the other hand . though the calorific value of fuel b is little less than that of fuel a . but it has the right ignition temperature of c which is neither very low nor very high . so . here fuel b will be a better fuel on the basis of its appropriate ignition temperature .
the source of nuclear energy is the mass of nucleus . a small amount of mass of nucleus is destroyed during a nuclear reaction which gets converted into a tremendous amount of energy . the nuclear energy is released mainly in the form of heat and some light . the nuclear energy is also known as atomic energy because it can be considered to be coming from the atoms . we will now describe the nuclear reactions of fission and fusion in detail . one by one . let us start with nuclear fission .
solar cooker the solar cooker is a device which is used to cook food by utilising the heat energy radiated by the sun . a solar cooker consists of an insulated metal box or wooden box which is painted all black from inside see figure . there is a thick glass sheet cover over the box and a plane mirror reflector is also attached to the box as shown in figure . the food to be cooked is put in metal containers which are painted black from outside . these metal containers are then placed inside the solar cooker box and covered with the glass sheet . we will now describe how the solar cooker works .

box type solar cooker principle a box type solar cooker is based on the following facts i glass possesses the property of selective transmission of heat radiation . ii a black body is a good absorber of heat radiation . iii a mirror or a polished surface reflects heat radiation according to the laws of reflection .
scattering of lights of different colours the colours of light scattered by a suspended particle depends on the size of the particle . very small particles scatter lights of shorter wavelengths better than those of longer wavelengths . from table . it is clear that bluish lights have shorter wavelengths than reddish lights . when white light is incident on small suspended particles . more of the shorter wavelengths of light bluish lights get scattered . very little of longer wavelengths of light reddish lights get scattered . so . the remaining light is reddish . the scattering of longer wavelengths of light increases as the size of the particles increases . large particles scatter lights of all wavelengths equally well . when smoke contains very fine particles of ash . the bluish lights get scattered . and the smoke looks milky blue . if the particles of ash are large . the entire light incident on it gets scattered . then the smoke looks white . clouds look white because of scattering by large drops of water in it .
 rules for image formation in lenses using ray diagrams for geometrical construction of an image formed by a lens . any of three of following rays of light are used incident on the lens parallel to principal axis after refraction from the lens . it actually passes through second principal focus f in case of a convex lens or appears to come from the second principal focus f in case of a concave lens . object at infinity . image at focus f incident on the lens through first principal focus fi in case of a convex lens or in direction of first principal focus f in case of a concave lens after refraction from the lens . it goes parallel to the principal axis . object at focus fÄ¯ . image at infinity incident on the lens in direction of optical centre it passes undeviated through the lens . f convex lens concave lens these special rays are very useful in drawing ray diagram in different cases .
 b how long will sun last the sun radiates energy at the rate of . w . since billion years . calculations have shown that the mass of the sun will exhaust in billion years more . hence solar energy will last till that large span of time . it is for this reason that we call solar energy as renewable non depletable . earth receives solar energy of about . kw mÂ² .

we know that an object say . a chair kept in a room can be seen from all the parts of the room . this is due to the fact that usually . because of its rough surface . an object reflects light or scatters light in all the directions . since the reflected light reaches all the parts of the room . the object can be seen from all the parts of the room . if . however . the surface of an object is smooth like that of a mirror . then the light falling on it is reflected in only one direction as shown in figure .
we define the electric potential difference between two points in an electric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit positive charge between the two points . potential difference v between two points work done w charge q if a work w is done in bringing a charge q from infinity to a point in an electric field . then potential at that point is given . w . . . . 
competition window astigmatism it is a defect of vision in which a person cannot simultaneously see both the horizontal and vertical views of an object with the same clarity . this defect can occur alongwith myopia or hypermetropia .
it may be mentioned here that the pollution caused by burning oil based products is more difficult to control than that produced by burning of coal . this is due to the reason that oil based fuels such as gasoline and diesel are burnt in moving vehicles . on the other hand . coal is burnt mainly in factories and thermal plants which cause pollution at a particular place . this pollution can be controlled more easily by installing tall chimneys and electrostatic precipitators . in addition . burning of gasoline also produces poisonous lead compounds . this type of pollution is not caused by burning of coal .
potential difference v across the wires is the same . you can of course verify this by connecting a voltmeter across ab . the different wires used in this experiment drew different currents when the same potential difference was applied across them . this means . the resistance of a wire of given length and cross sectional area depends on the material of the wire .
 i from point a . we draw an incident ray ac perpendicular to the mirror see figure . this will be reflected back along the same path . so . ca is the first reflected ray . we now draw another incident ray ad which strikes the mirror at point d . the ray ad is reflected along de . making an angle of reflection ri equal to the angle of incidence ii . thus . de is the second reflected ray here . we produce the two reflected rays ca and de backwards by dotted lines . they meet at point a a dash . so . a is the virtual image of the top point a of the object .
axis windmill for producing electricity wind generator electricity is produced when an armature of a horizontal armature of generator rotates between two poles north and wind generator south poles of a strong magnet . when wind falls electricity on the wheel of a windmill . it rotates . the axle of the armature is connected to the shaft of the wind mill . so the armature of the generator rotates between two poles of a magnet along with the pole rotation of the wheel of the windmill . thus . electric current is produced . this is how . the kinetic energy of the wind is converted into electric energy . it may be noted that electricity produced by a single windmill is very small . which cannot be used for commercial purpose . to produce electricity in a region . large number of windmills are installed . the region where large number of windmills are erected to produce electricity is called wind energy farm . the small amount of electricity produced by each generator connected to each windmill is combined to get electricity on a large scale .
side . the silver coating is protected by a red paint . these days mirrors are being made increasingly by depositing a thin coating of aluminium metal at the back of a glass sheet instead of silver coating . this is because aluminium is much cheaper than silver and it reflects light very well . a plane mirror is shown in figure a . the mirror on our dressing table in which we see our face is a plane mirror .

 a fig . a ray falling on the pole is reflected in accordance with the laws of reflection . although four different rays are shown to locate an image . only two are really needed the third or the fourth ray is usually drawn to serve as a check . in a similar fashion . rays from all points of the object locate corresponding points on the image . and the mirror forms a complete image of the object . the image is real if the light rays actually pass through a point and the image is virtual if the light rays seem to come from a point . in all the above reflections taking place the laws of reflection are strictly obeyed .
motor and generator many electrical devices are based on the relationship between electricity and magnetism . two of the most important ones are the electric motor and the electric generator . fans . mixies . cd players . motorized toys . etc . . use motors . motors are of different types . some . like the motor in a toy car . work only on batteries . while others . like the motor of an electric pump . work on the household electric supply . actually . the currents drawn from a battery and the household supply are different in nature . when an electrical device such as a bulb is connected to a battery . the current in the circuit always flows from the positive terminal higher potential of the battery to the negative terminal lower potential . a current that always flows in the same direction through an electrical device is called a direct current dc . however . the direction of the current flowing through the bulb of a reading lamp connected to the household supply changes rapidly every second . such a current is called an alternating current ac . electric motors and generators that work on dc or ac are only slightly different in construction . the principles of physics
some important conclusions according to the sign convention . the distances towards the left of the mirror are negative . since an object is always placed to the left side of a mirror . therefore . the object distance u is always negative .
a solenoid is a long . helically wound coil of insulated copper wire . a solenoid is shown in figure a .
factors affecting the resistance of a conductor the electrical resistance of a conductor or a wire depends on the following factors i length of the conductor . ii area of cross section of the conductor or thickness of the conductor . iii nature of the material of the conductor . and iv temperature of the conductor . we will now describe how the resistance depends on these factors .
nuclear fusion the process of combination of two light nuclei to form a heavy nucleus is known as nuclear fusion . obviously . the process of fusion is just the reverse of fission . an important feature of fusion is that there is a release of huge amount of energy in the process . this can be easily understood . when two light nuclei combine to form a heavy nucleus . there occurs a small mass defect . in other words . the mass of the heavy nucleus turns out to be less than the sum of the masses of two light nuclei . this small mass defect results in the release of a huge amount of energy according to einstein mass energy relation ae am c for example . by the fusion of two nuclei of heavy hydrogen or deuterium h . the following reaction is possible hÂ² hÂ² hÂ² h . mev
case . when the object is at infinity when the object is at a very large distance . we say that the object is at infinity . in figure we have a concave mirror m . suppose an object an arrow pointing upwards has been placed at infinity in front of the concave mirror since the object is very far off . it cannot be shown in the diagram . because the object ab is very far off . the two rays ad and ap coming from its top point a are parallel to one another but at an angle to the principal axis as shown in figure . these parallel rays get reflected at points d and p and then intersect at point a in the focal plane of the mirror . thus . a is the real image of the top point a of the object . to get the full image of the object . we draw a b perpendicular to the principal axis from a . thus . a b is the image of the object ab placed at infinity . we find that image a b is formed at the focus f of the concave mirror .
let us take the reciprocal of this equation . this will give us Âº n v . . . . . . . now . if we compare equations and . we find that their right hand sides are equal . so their left hand sides should also be equal . thus . m this can also be written as medium n medium medium n medium this means that the refractive index for light going from medium to medium is equal to the reciprocal of refractive index for light going from medium to medium . if medium is air and medium is glass . then the above relation can be written as air n glass glass nair or ng na g thus . the refractive index of glass for light going from air to glass is the reciprocal of the refractive index for light going from glass to air . let us solve some problems now .
images formed by a convex mirror in a convex mirror . the image is always formed behind the mirror . between the pole and the focus . the image is always virtual . erect and smaller than the object . as the object moves away from the mirror . its image moves towards the focus . and when the object is at infinity . the image is formed at the focus . image formation by a convex mirror is shown in table . . if you place a small plane mirror in front of a large building . you will be able to see only a part of the building in the mirror . however . if you place a convex mirror of small focal length at the same place . you may be able to see the whole building . that is because convex mirrors form images that are smaller than the objects . so we are able to see the images of wide areas in them . after going through the tables on the formation of images by spherical mirrors . you would have noticed that the real images formed by spherical mirrors are always inverted and the virtual images are always erect .
if the two spheres are connected by a metal wire . electrons from the negatively charged sphere at a lower potential will flow to the positively charged sphere at a higher potential . eventually . the flow of electrons causes the charges on the spheres to become balanced . when that happens . the spheres no longer carry a net charge . and therefore . have equal potential . so . the flow of electrons stops . we can thus say that a potential difference causes charges to flow .
 . . limitations of hydroelectricity the following are the limitations of hydroelectricity i hydro energy power project is a huge project . ii high rise dams are constructed on rivers which may give rise to a number of environmental problems . for example . in order to carry out the project huge dams are required and the construction of which destroys natural flora and fauna as well as human settlements . iii aquatic animals are widely affected due to the construction of dams because they do not get sufficient nutrient materials in the downstream areas which further decrease the production of fish . iv the construction of dams also stops the flow of nutrient rich silt to the plains . this deteriorates the quality of soil and hence the quality of crops . v a hydroelectric power stations cannot be constructed everywhere . vi in construction of dams the vegetation which is submerged rots under anaerobic conditions and gives rise to large amounts of methane which is also a greenhouse gas . vii it creates the problem of satisfactory rehabilitation of displaced people .

when light is going from vacuum to another medium . then the value of refractive index is called the absolute refractive index . the absolute refractive index has only one subscript with its symbol n on its right side which indicates the name of the medium the word vacuum is not written as a subscript . for example . for the light going from vacuum into glass . the absolute refractive index of glass is represented as nglass and not as vacuumnglass . the symbol nglass means that it is the refractive index of glass with respect to vacuum . that is . it is the refractive index of glass for light entering from vacuum into glass . please note that the symbol nglass is also written in short as ng .

nuclear energy the process of a heavy nucleus splitting into two middleweight nuclei is called nuclear fission . u absorbs a slow neutron to become u . which splits fissions to give about mev of energy . a reaction that continues on its own as one occurrence of the reaction triggers the next occurrence is called a chain reaction . controlled chain reaction is used in nuclear power plants . to generate electricity . the energy released by nuclear fission in a nuclear reactor is used to generate steam . which drives turbines connected to generators . the process of two or more light nuclei combining to form a heavier nucleus is called nuclear fusion . energy in the sun is produced by the fusion of hydrogen into helium . scientists are working hard to produce energy from fusion reactions . the high temperatures about k required for fusion is posing many problems .
uses of convex mirrors i convex mirrors are used as rear view mirrors in vehicles like cars . trucks and buses to see the traffic at the rear side or back side see figure . a driver prefers to use a convex mirror as rear view mirror because of two reasons a a convex mirror always produces an erect right side up image of the objects . b the image formed in a convex mirror is highly diminished or much smaller than the object . due to which a convex mirror gives a wide field of view of the traffic behind see figure a . a convex mirror enables a driver to view much larger area of the traffic behind him than would be possible with a plane mirror . a plane mirror gives a narrow field of view see figure b . due to this if a plane mirror

real and virtual images consider the situation shown in figure . a . a concave mirror reflects rays of light coming from the point a . the reflected rays intersect at the point a . to a person s eye located beyond a . the reflected rays will appear to come from a . hence . the eye will see an image of a at a . if a screen is placed at a . the rays will intersect on the screen . forming an image on it . an image formed by the actual intersection of light rays is called a real image . a real image can be formed on a screen . in figure . b . a convex mirror reflects the rays starting from the point b . the reflected rays do not actually intersect . but when produced backwards . they meet at the point b . to the eye receiving the reflected rays . they appear to come from b . and hence . an image is seen there . unlike the situation shown in figure . a . no light reaches b . where the image is formed . such an image . as you know . is called a virtual image . if the rays of light responsible for an image do not

at the time of sunrise and sunset when the sun is near the horizon . the sunlight has to travel the greatest distance through the atmosphere to reach us . during this long journey of sunlight . most of the shorter wavelength blue colour present in it is scattered out and away from our line of sight . so . the light reaching us directly from the rising sun or setting sun consists mainly of longer wavelength red colour due to which the sun appears red see figure . due to the same reason . the sky surrounding the rising sun and setting sun also appears red . thus . at sunrise and sunset . the sun itself as well as the surrounding sky appear red .

electric current is the amount of charge that crosses per unit time through a surface . in much the same sense that a river current is the amount of water flowing per unit of time . thus . electric current is defined as the rate of flow of electric charge i . e . . quantity of charge flowing per unit time . suppose q is the amount of charge that passes through the surface in a time t . here . q is given by q ne . where n is the number of electrons and e is the charge on each electron . if the rate is constant . the current i is equal to the charge divided by the time . . . . since the units for charge and time are the coulomb c and the second s respectively . therefore . the si unit for current is a coulomb per second c s . one coulomb per second is referred to as an ampere a . after the french mathematician andre marie ampere .

solar cells a device which converts solar energy directly into electricity is called a solar cell or a photovoltaic pv cell . some substances like silicon are semiconductors . their ability to conduct electricity is much less than that of conductors . however . when certain substances are added to semiconductors . they are able to conduct electricity much better . solar cells are made from such altered semiconductors . when sunlight falls on a solar cell . a potential difference of about . v develops across it . the power of a solar cell depends on its surface area . the greater the surface area of the solar cell . the greater is the solar energy collected by it . and hence . the greater is the power generated . small solar cells are . therefore suitable for use in only those electronic devices that require very little power . such devices include calculators and watches . a typical solar cell delivers much less power than a common dry cell .

laws of refraction . the incident ray . the refracted ray and the normal to the refracting surface at the point of incidence are in the same plane . . the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction satisfy the equation sin i . sinr my of a pair of transparent media . the one that has the higher refractive index is called the optically denser medium of the two . while the one that has the lower refractive index is called the optically rarer medium . when light goes from the optically rarer medium to the optically denser medium . it bends towards the normal . and when it goes from the denser medium to the rarer medium . it bends away from the normal . the total reflection of light travelling in a medium of higher refractive index m when it is incident on the boundary with another medium of lower refractive index n . at an angle greater than the critical angle . is called total internal reflection . the critical angle is given by sini . . when a ray of light passes through a transparent slab with parallel faces . it is displaced parallel to itself . a lens that is thicker at the middle than at the edges is called a convex lens . while a lens that is thicker at the edges is called a concave lens . the central point of a lens is called its optical centre . a ray of light incident towards the optical centre passes almost undeviated through the lens .
point to remember is that the various distribution circuits are connected in parallel so that if a fault occurs in one circuit . its fuse will melt leaving the other circuit in operation . for example . the lighting circuit and power circuit in our home are in parallel so that if a short circuit occurs in . say the power circuit . then the power fuse will blow off but our lights will not go off because our lighting circuit will keep working .
action of a concave lens on a parallel beam of light rays is shown in figure . when a parallel beam of light rays falls on a concave lens . the rays will spread out or diverge after passing through the lens . since the refracted rays are diverging away from one another . they do not actually meet at a point . the diverging rays when produced backwards as shown by dotted lines in figure appear to meet at a point f on the left side of the lens . to a person on the right hand side . the refracted rays appear to be diverging or coming from a point f on the principal axis of the concave lens . this point is the principal focus of the concave lens . thus . the principal focus of a concave lens is a point on its principal axis from which light rays . originally parallel to the axis .
when the object is at infinity when the object is at a far off distance . we say that the object is at infinity . in figure . we have a convex mirror m . suppose an object an arrow pointing upwards has been placed at infinity in front of the convex mirror since the object is very far off . it cannot be shown in the diagram . because the object ab is very far off . the two rays ad and ap coming from its top point a are parallel to one another but at an angle to the principal axis as shown in figure . the ray ad gets reflected in the direction dx and the ray ap gets reflected in the direction py . when the diverging reflected rays dx and py are produced backwards as shown by dotted lines in figure . they intersect at point a in the focal plane of the convex mirror . thus . a is the virtual image of the top point a of the object . to get the full image of the object

it is also worth noting that if magnification is greater than one . then the image is bigger than the object and if it is less than one . then the image is smaller than the object . a magnification equal to one indicates that the image and the object are of the same size .

note i magnetic field inside a long solenoid is uniform i . e . . same at all points and strong . this magnetic field is represented by straight magnetic field lines parallel and very close to each other . ii magnetic field inside a long solenoid decreases as we move towards the ends of the solenoid because magnetic field lines near the ends of the solenoid start spreading out . iii magnetic field outside the solenoid is non uniform and weak . iv magnetic field lines inside the solenoid are from south pole to north pole and outside the solenoid . these lines of force are from north pole to south pole . v the magnetic field of the solenoid resembles the magnetic field of the bar magnet as shown in figure . vi the strong magnetic field produced inside a solenoid is used to magnetise the rod of a magnetic material like soft iron . when placed inside the bar magnet solenoid . f

before we end this discussion on solar energy . we would like to compare the fossil fuels and the sun as sources of energy . i the sun is a renewable source of energy but fossil fuels are a non renewable source of energy . ii the sun s energy does not cause any pollution but burning of fossil fuels causes a lot of pollution . iii the sun s energy is available in a diffused form scattered form but fossil fuels provide energy in concentrated form . iv a special device like solar cooker or solar cell is always needed to utilise sun s energy but this is not so in the case of fossil fuels . v the sun s energy is available only during the day time when the sun shines but energy of fossil fuels can be used all the time .
pollution caused by burning fossil fuels the burning of most fossil fuels causes air pollution . the pollutants produced include carbon dioxide . carbon monoxide . oxides of nitrogen . sulphur dioxide and unburnt particles . a burning of fossil fuels like coal and petrol produces carbon dioxide . excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing the greenhouse effect . leading to unnatural global warming . b when coal and petrol do not burn completely . carbon monoxide is produced . excessive inhalation of this poisonous gas can cause death . c during the combustion of coal . sulphur present in it forms sulphur dioxide . oxides of nitrogen are formed when atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen combine at the high temperatures inside a running automobile engine . in the air . sulphur dioxide combines with oxygen and water to form sulphuric acid . oxides of nitrogen form nitric acid . these fall on the earth with rain . which we call acid rain . acid rain damages soil . water bodies . crops . living tissues and structures like the taj mahal . d the unburnt particles produced during the combustion of fossil fuels are carried by smoke . they affect our lungs . and blacken clothes and buildings . the pollution caused by burning coal can be greatly reduced by installing a tall chimney or by installing a precipitator . which is a device that reduces the amount of suspended matter in the smoke .
illustrations why series arrangement is not used for domestic circuits ans . in domestic circuits . series arrangement is not used because of the following reasons i the total potential difference available usually volts is divided between various appliances in the circuit according to their resistances since the current flowing through all the appliances is the same . thus . each appliance will not get the required potential difference for it to operate properly . ii if one of the appliances is out of order . e . g . . if a bulb gets fused . all the appliances in the circuit will stop working as the circuit gets broken . iii all the appliances will work simultaneously whether we want them to work or not . thereby involving a lot of power wastage . iv if we switch off any one of the appliances . the circuit is broken and all the appliances will stop working .
since work is measured in joule and charge in coulomb . therefore . electric potential is measured in joule per coulomb jc . this unit occurs so often in our study of electricity . that it has been named as volt . in honour of the scientist alessandro volta the inventor of the voltaic cell . thus . joule volt coulomb potential difference is said to be v when joule of work is done to move c of charge between two points .

efficiency of solar heating device is much lower than that of electrical heating devices because solar energy is available in the diffused form and the energy of electric heating device is in concentrated form .
the main disadvantage of solar cells is that they are very expensive . this is due to the following reasons i the special grade silicon needed for making solar cells is expensive . ii silver wire used to interconnect solar cells for making solar cell panels is expensive . and iii the entire process of making solar cells is still very expensive . so . the extensive use of solar cells for generating electric power is limited due to their high cost . another disadvantage of solar cells is their low efficiency . they can convert only about per cent of the light energy falling on them into electricity .

refracted ray ob bends away from the normal at point b by an equal amount . thus . the light emerges from a parallel sided glass slab in a direction parallel with that in which it enters the glass slab . though the emergent ray bc is parallel to the incident ray ao . but the emergent ray has been sideways displaced or laterally displaced from the original path of the incident ray by a perpendicular distance cd see figure . in figure . the original path of incident light is aod but the emergent light goes along bc . the lateral displacement between them being cd . the perpendicular distance between the original path of incident ray and the emergent ray coming out of the glass slab is called lateral displacement of the emergent ray of light . lateral displacement depends mainly on three factors angle of incidence . thickness of glass slab . and refractive index of glass slab . actually . lateral

we cannot join the battery wires directly to the two commutator half rings to pass current into the coil because if we do so . then the connecting wires will get twisted when the coil rotates . so . to pass in electric current to the coil . we use two carbon strips p and q known as brushes . the carbon brushes p and q are fixed to the base of the motor and they press lightly against the two half rings of the commutator . the battery to supply current to the coil is connected to the two carbon brushes p and q through a switch .
how to get a continuous flow of electric current we have just studied that it is due to the potential difference between two points that an electric current flows between them . the simplest way to maintain a potential difference between the two ends of a conductor so as to get a continuous flow of current is to connect the conductor between the terminals of a cell or a battery . due to the chemical reactions going on inside the cell or battery . a potential difference is maintained between its terminals . and this potential difference drives the current in a circuit in which the cell or battery is connected . for example . a single dry cell has a potential difference of . volts between its two terminals terminal and terminal . so . when a dry cell is connected to a torch bulb through copper connecting wires . then its potential difference causes the electric current to flow through the copper wires and the bulb . due to which the bulb lights up see figure . in order to maintain current in the external circuit . the cell has to expend the chemical energy which is stored in it . please note that the torch bulb used in the circuit shown in figure is actually a

we conclude the following from the above activity . a a current flows through a coil as long as a magnet moves near the coil . the coil moves near the magnet or both of them move . so . a current flows in the coil when there is relative motion between the magnet and the coil . b while there is relative motion between the magnet and the coil . the magnetic field around the coil keeps changing . the changing magnetic field causes a current in the coil .

eye is small as in a dark room or during night . the iris expands the pupil makes the pupil large so that more light may enter the eyes see figure . thus . the iris regulates or controls the amount of light entering the eye by changing the size of the pupil . the iris makes the pupil expand or contract according to the intensity of light around the eye . if the intensity of the outside light is low . then the pupil expands to allow more light to enter the eye . on the other hand . if outside intensity of light is high . then the pupil contracts so that less light enters the eye .

principle it is based on the principle that when a current carrying conductor capable of moving freely is placed in a magnetic field . it experiences a force and begins to move in a direction given by fleming s left hand rule . construction a dc motor consists of the following components as shown in figure . .
the focus of concave mirror is in front of the mirror on the left side . so the focal length of a concave mirror is considered negative and written with a minus sign . say . cm . on the other hand . the focus of a convex mirror is behind the mirror on the right side . so the focal length of a convex mirror is positive and written with a plus sign . say cm or just cm .
the ability to attract small pieces of paper and are said to have electric charge .
of the convex lens . so . in this case . the object and its image are at equal distance f each from the convex lens . but they are on opposite sides of the lens . thus . when an object is placed at a distance f in front of a convex lens . then the image formed is i at a distance f on the other side of the lens . ii real and inverted . and iii of the same size as the object .
to determine the focal length of a convex lens . we put the convex lens in a holder or stand and keep it in front of a distant object like a window or a tree . so that the rays coming from the window pass through it . a cardboard screen is put behind the lens . we change the distance of the screen from the convex lens until a clear inverted image of the window is formed on the screen . measure the distance of the screen from the lens with a scale . this distance will be the focal length of convex lens . for example . if the image of a distant window is formed at a distance of cm from a convex lens . then the focal length of this convex lens will be cm . and before we end this discussion . here is a summary of the images formed by a convex lens .

 the images formed by a concave mirror can be either behind the mirror virtual or in front of the mirror real . so . the image distance v for a concave mirror can be either positive or negative depending on the position of the image . if an image is formed behind a concave mirror to the right side . the image distance v is positive but if the image is formed in front of the mirror on the left side . then the image distance will be negative .

biogas is a mixture of methane . carbon dioxide . hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide .
we can see the effect of atmospheric refraction by a simple observation as follows if we look at objects through the hot air over a fire . the objects appear to be moving slightly . this can be explained as follows the air just above the fire becomes hotter than the air further up . this hotter air is optically rarer but the colder air further up is optically denser . so . when we see the objects by the light coming from them through hot and cold air layers having different optical densities . then refraction of light takes place randomly due to which the objects appear to be moving slightly . this is an example of atmospheric refraction on a small scale .

rainbow it is the example of dispersion of sunlight . when sunlight falls on a water drop suspended in air . then the sunlight is refracted . the refracted sunlight splits or dispersed into its constituent colours i . e . . seven colours . thus . water drop suspended in air behaves as a glass prism . the red colour deviates the least and the violet colour deviated the most . different colours of refracted sunlight fall on the opposite face of the water drop . now . each colour is partly reflected back into the drop . the reflected colours on reaching the lower surface of water drop are refracted again into

 . cause of refraction and refractive index n when light passes from one medium into another . it is refracted because the speed of light is different in the two media . in general . one finds that the speed of light in any material is less than the speed of light in vacuum . it should be noted that greater the difference in the speed of light in the two media . greater is the bending of light . the extent of the bending that takes place in a given pair of media is expressed in terms of the refractive index . the constant appearing on the left hand side of equation . . in fact . light travels at its maximum speed in vacuum . it is convenient to define the refractive index . n of a medium to be the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum c to the speed of light in the given medium v . mathematically . we express it as speed of light in vacuum speed of light in medium c v . . . . 
activity keep a glass of water on a table . ask your friends to sit about m from the table . hold a coin in your hand and move it slowly near the glass . one by one your friends should cover one eye and say when the coin is just above the glass . when they say so . drop the coin . you will find that in most cases your friends judge the position of the coin wrongly . and the coin falls outside the glass . but if they look through both the eyes . they will be able to judge the position of the coin correctly most of the time . and the coin will drop into the glass . this happens because we are unable to judge depth . or the relative distances between objects . with one eye . especially when the objects are at some distance from the eye . two eyes are required to perceive depth . also . we can see a wider area with two eyes than with one eye .
ohm s law ohm s law gives a relationship between current and potential difference . according to ohm s law at constant temperature . the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across its ends . if i is the current flowing through a conductor and v is the potential difference or voltage across its ends . then according to ohm s law i a v at constant temp . this can also be written as v i or v rxi where r is a constant called resistance of the conductor . the value of this constant depends on the nature . length . area of cross section and temperature of the conductor . the above equation can also be written as v r . . . where v potential difference i current and r resistance which is a constant

e second principal focus second principal focus b first principal focus first principal focus a d fig . . if we stick to the convention that light is always incident from left to right on the lens . the first principal focus fy of a convex lens is on the left of the lens . and the second principal focus f . is on its right . for a concave lens . f is on the right and f is on the left of the lens . for a thin lens . the distances of fÄ¯ and f . from the optical centre are the same . this distance is called the focal length of the lens . also . we usually use the word focus for each of the two principal focii . it is generally clear from the situation whether we are talking of for f . and a common symbol f is used for them . thus we can define the focus and focal length of a thin lens as follows . in a thin lens . rays incident parallel to the principal axis after passing through the lens converge to or appear to diverge from a point on the principal axis . and . the rays coming from a point on the principal axis or rays going towards a point on it become parallel to the principal axis after passing through the lens . each of these two points is called a focus of the thin lens . and the distance of the focus from the optical centre is called its focal length . usually . when we say focus . we mean the second principal focus . since a parallel beam of light incident on a convex lens converges on the other side . a convex lens is also called a converging lens figure . a . on the other hand . a parallel beam of light incident on a concave lens diverges on the other side figure . b . a concave lens is therefore also called a diverging lens .

principle of electric generator the electric generator is an application of electromagnetic induction . the electric generator works on the principle that when a straight conductor is moved in a magnetic field . then current is induced in the conductor . in an electric generator . a rectangular coil having straight sides is made to rotate rapidly in the magnetic field between the poles of a horseshoe type magnet . when the coil rotates . it cuts the magnetic field lines due to which a current is produced in the coil . electric generators are of two types . alternating current generator a . c . generator . and . direct current generator or d . c . generator . please note that a . c . generator is also written as a . c . generator and d . c . generator is also written as d . c . generator . we will now discuss both the types of electric generators . one by one . let us start with the a . c . generator .
we know that though stars twinkle at night but planets do not twinkle at all . this can be explained as follows the stars appear very . very small to us because they are very . very far off . so . stars can be considered to be point sources of light . the continuously changing atmosphere is able to cause variations in the light coming from a point sized star due to refraction because of which the star appears to be twinkling . on the other hand . the planets appear to be quite big to us because they are much nearer to the earth . so . a planet can be considered to be a collection of a very large number of point sources of light . the dimming effect produced by some of the point sources of light in one part of the planet is nullified by the brighter effect produced by the point sources of light in its other part . thus . on the whole . the brightness of a planet always remains the same and hence it does not appear to twinkle . we can now say that the continuously changing atmosphere is unable to cause variations in the light coming from a big sized planet due to refraction because of which the planet does not twinkle at all .
we find that a potential difference is induced in the coil whenever the electric current through the coil is changing starting or stopping . coil is called the primary coil and coil is called the secondary coil . as the current in the first coil changes . the magnetic field associated with it also changes . thus . the magnetic field lines around the secondary coil also change . hence . the change in magnetic field lines associated with the secondary coil is the cause of induced electric current in it .
 . refraction through a glass prism a prism is a refracting medium bounded by intersecting plane surfaces that both disperse and deviate light . the two plane surfaces meet along an edge at a certain angle . these planes are called the refracting surfaces . the edge is called the refracting edge and the angle is called the angle of prism or the refracting angle . a prism may be bounded by any number of surfaces but the surface on which light is incident and the surface from which light emerges must be plane and non parallel .

procedure the circuit is connected as shown in figure . . the rheostat is varied to adjust the value of potential in the circuit . for some known values of potential the corresponding values of current is noted with the help of the ammeter . this gives a number of sets of observations of potential and current . a graph is plotted between voltage along x axis and current along y axis . the graph is found to be a straight line fig . . this verifies ohm s law . the reciprocal of the slope of the graph gives the value of the resistance of the resistor .
if the direction of the current is reversed . the field lines will still be circular . but the directions of the field lines will be reversed figure . b . this means . the north pole of the needle will point in the opposite direction . you can also sprinkle iron filings on the cardboard to see how the field lines are arranged . while a current is passing through the wire . gently tap the cardboard . the iron filings will get arranged in concentric circles . suggesting that the field lines due to a current passing through a straight wire are circular .
 ii non renewable sources of energy or conventional sources of energy those sources of energy which have been accumulated in nature over a very long time millions of years and cannot be quickly replaced if once exhausted are called non renewable sources of energy . the formation of fossil fuels like coal . petroleum and natural gas . have occurred over millions of years due to certain very slow changes under special circumstances . since these conditions are not prevailing now . the fossil fuels are rare . these sources of energy are . therefore . classified as non renewable sources .
electromagnet we know that the magnetic field inside a current carrying solenoid is uniform . this property of a solenoid is used to magnetise magnetic materials . an electromagnet is a temporary strong magnet and is just a solenoid with its winding on a soft iron core .
refraction of light by spherical lenses we have all seen a palmist using a lens called magnifying glass for seeing the details of the lines of a person s palm . a watch maker also uses a lens to see the extremely small parts of a watch clearly . in fact . lenses play a very important role in our everyday life . lenses are used in making spectacles . cameras . microscopes . telescopes . film projectors . and many . many other optical instruments . we have already studied that the working of a mirror is based on the reflection of light rays from its surface . the working of a lens is based on the refraction of light rays when they pass through it . we will now study the formation of images by lenses in detail . before we do that . we should know the various types of spherical lenses and the terms like optical centre . principal axis . principal focus or just focus . and focal length . etc . . which are used in the study of refraction of light by lenses . these are discussed below .
 iii near the magnetic poles where the field is stronger . the lines of force are closer . going away from the poles . the field becomes weaker and the lines become rarer . thus . larger the number of lines of force at a given point . stronger is the magnetic field at that point .

since a concave mirror can produce virtual images as well as real images . the magnification produced by a concave mirror can be either positive or negative . a convex mirror . however . forms only virtual images . so the magnification produced by a convex mirror is always positive . another point to be noted is that if the magnification m has a value greater than then the image is bigger than the object . that is . the image is magnified or enlarged . and if the magnification m is exactly . then the image is of the same size as the object . but if the magnification is less than then the image is smaller than the object or diminished .

working of a motor when an electric current is passed into the rectangular coil . this current produces a magnetic field around the coil . the magnetic field of the horseshoe type magnet then interacts with the magnetic field of the current carrying coil and causes the coil to rotate or spin continuously . the working of a motor will become more clear from the following discussion .

when a ray of light goes from a rarer medium to a denser medium . its speed decreases or it slows down . on the other hand . when a ray of light goes from a denser medium to a rarer medium . then its speed increases or it speeds up . so . we can now say that a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a denser medium slows down and bends towards the normal but when a ray of light travels from a denser medium to a rarer medium . it speeds up and bends away from the normal .

electric potential when a small positive test charge is placed in the electric field due to another charge . it experiences a force . so work has to be done on the positive test charge to move it against this force of repulsion . p p infinity bringing a unit positive charge q from electric field of a charged infinity to a point p in an electric field of a charged body a body a the electric potential or simply potential at a point in an electric field is defined as the amount of work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to that point without acceleration . electric potential is a scalar quantity and it is denoted by v . if w is the amount of work done in bringing a unit charge q from infinity to a point . then the electric potential v at that point is given by . work done w electric potential . v charge the si unit of electric potential is volt . joule j the si unit of work is joule j and that of charge is coulomb c . so . volt coulomb 
during high tide . when the level of water in the sea is high . sea water flows into the reservoir of the barrage and turns the turbines see figure a . the turbines then turn the generators to produce electricity . and during the low tide . when the level of sea water is low . the sea water stored in the barrage reservoir is allowed to flow out into the sea . this flowing water also turns the turbines and generates electricity see figure b . thus . as sea water flows in and out of the tidal barrage during high and low tides . it turns the turbines to generate electricity . the tidal energy is not likely to be a potential source of energy in future because of the following reasons i there are very few sites around the world which are suitable for building tidal barrages or tidal dams .
when light is going from one medium other than vacuum or air to another medium . then the value of refractive index is called relative refractive index . for example . when the light is going from water into glass . then the value of refractive index will be the relative refractive index of glass with respect to water . the relative refractive index has always two subscripts with its symbol n which indicate the two media in which the light travels . for example . for the light going from water to glass . the refractive index is written as watern glass or wnÄ . the symbol watern glass means that it is the refractive index of glass with respect to water . that is . it is the refractive index of glass for light entering from water into glass .
the advantage of otec over tidal wave energy is that one does not have to wait for the tides .
combination of resistors two or more resistors are said to be connected in series if the current flowing through one also flows through the rest . the total potential difference across the combination is equal to the sum of the potential differences across the individual resistors . if resistors are connected in such a way that the same potential difference gets applied to each of them . they are said to be connected in parallel . the total current flowing into the combination is equal to the sum of the currents through the individual resistors .
 . due to the construction of dam on the river . the fish in the downstream area do not get sufficient nutrient materials due to which the production of fish decreases rapidly because the fish nutrients remain trapped in the reservoir formed by the dam .
this is also what happens when white light is incident on a rectangular glass slab the light does suffer dispersion inside the glass slab . but they emerge into air on the opposite side parallel to each other and also to the original ray . the eye lens focuses these parallel rays of different colours to one spot on the retina and we see white light .
 disconnect coil a from the battery . you will observe that the pointer of the galvanometer moves . but to the opposite side and quickly returns to zero indicating a momentary current in coil b . however . this current flows in the opposite direction in coil b a shown in figure c . coil a coil b hhhh log c momentary current in coil b . the current flows in the opposite direction .
myopia is due to the following reasons either the eyeball is longer than normal or ii the maximum focal length due to excessive curvature of the eye lens of the lens is insufficient to produce a clearly formed image on the retina . com fig . a corrected myopia eye .

 . second law the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant for a given pair of media . and this constant is called the refractive index of the medium .
since the potential difference v across both the resistances r and r in parallel is the same . so by applying ohm s law to each resistance separately . we get . . . and . . . now . putting the values of i . and from equations . and in equation . we get v . v . v rr r or cancelling v from both sides . we get r rr thus . if two resistances r and r are connected in parallel . then their resultant resistance r is given by the formula . r r r 
magnetic field lines a magnetic field is described by drawing the magnetic field lines . when a small north magnetic pole is placed in the magnetic field created by a magnet . it will experience a force . and if the north pole is free . it will move under the influence of magnetic field . the path traced by a north magnetic pole free to move under the influence of a magnetic field is called a magnetic field line . in other words . the magnetic field lines are the lines drawn in a magnetic field along which a north magnetic pole would move . the magnetic field lines are also known as magnetic lines of force . the direction of a magnetic field line at any point gives the direction of the magnetic force on a north pole placed at that point . since the direction of magnetic field line is the direction of force on a north pole . so the magnetic field lines always begin from the n pole of a magnet and end on the s pole of the magnet see figure . inside the magnet . however . the direction of magnetic field lines is from the s pole of the magnet to the n pole of the magnet . thus . the magnetic field lines are closed curves . the magnetic field lines due to a bar magnet are shown in figure . when a small compass is moved along a magnetic field line . the compass needle always sets itself along the line tangential to it . so . a line drawn from the south pole of the compass needle to its north pole indicates the direction of the magnetic field at that point . we will now describe how the magnetic field lines or magnetic field produced by a bar magnet can be plotted on paper .
starting from the upper point a of the object ab . we draw a line ad parallel to the principal axis . now . according to the first rule of image formation . this parallel ray ad should appear to be coming from focus f after refraction . so . we join df by a dotted line and produce fd upwards in the direction

to sense image information . the retina has two types of sense receptors . they are called rods and cones named so because that is how they look under high magnification . there are about million cones and million rods on the retina . the rods can sense very small amounts of light . while the cones need more light to perform their task of sensing colours and details . that is why in dim light we are able to see shapes but not colours and details . the rods and cones are actually the ends of special light sensitive nerve cells . the long fibres or axons of these nerve cells come together at a point on the retina to form an optic nerve . which is connected to the brain . when light falls on the rods and cones . electrical signals are generated . these signals are transmitted to the brain via the optic nerves . there are no rods or cones at the spot where the optic nerve leaves the eyeball . if an image is formed on this region of the retina . it

 c the direction of the current depends on the direction of the magnetic field . that is why it changes when the pole facing the coil is changed . d the direction of the current depends on whether the magnetic field around the coil is increasing or decreasing . the magnetic field around the coil increases as the coil and magnet come closer . and decreases as they move apart . that is why the current flows in one direction on moving the magnet towards the coil and in the opposite direction on moving the magnet away from the coil . a current produced by a changing magnetic field is called an induced current . this phenomenon is called electromagnetic induction . electromagnetic induction the phenomenon in which an electric current is induced in a circuit because of a changing magnetic field is called electromagnetic induction . electromagnetic induction was discovered by michael faraday in . this important discovery revealed another link between electricity and magnetism . not only can we use an electric current to produce a magnetic field . we can also use a magnetic field to produce an electric current .

total internal reflection let a ray of light travel from a medium of higher refractive index n . to a medium of lower refractive index n . as shown in figure . a . go n na n ny n ng n a b c fig . . after refraction . the ray of light bends away from the normal . therefore . the angle of refraction is greater than the angle of incidence . i . e . . r i . now . if the angle of incidence i increases . the angle of refraction r increases . for a particular value of i . called the critical angle ic . the angle of refraction becomes figure . b . the refracted ray then comes out parallel to the surface separating the two media . what happens for an angle of incidence greater than the critical angle you would expect the angle of refraction to be more than . this would bring the ray back into the first medium . but that would not be refraction . this means that for an angle of incidence greater than ic . refraction is not possible . so . the ray reflects back into the first medium . this reflection obeys the laws of reflection . and therefore . r in figure . c . such a reflection is called total internal reflection . remember that total internal reflection takes place only for light travelling from a medium of higher refractive index to a medium of lower refractive index . the total reflection of light travelling in a medium of higher refractive index when it is incident on the boundary with another medium of lower refractive index at an angle greater than the critical angle . is called total internal reflection . why total you know that when light falls obliquely on the interface between two transparent media . a small part of the light is reflected into the first medium . but when the angle

assumptions and sign convention while dealing with the reflection of light by spherical mirrors . we shall follow a set of sign conventions called the new cartesian sign convention . the conventions are as follows . the object is always taken on left side of the mirror . all distances are measured from the pole of the mirror . distances actually traversed in the direction of light are taken as positive and those in the opposite direction are taken as negative . all the distances above the principal axis are considered to be positive and below the principal axis are considered to be negative .
